**Example solve from Stefan Pochmann**

## Description

**Creator:** [Stefan Pochmann](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#pochmann-stefan)

**Created:** 2006-2007

**Steps:**

1. Solve the edges using setup moves and M2 turns.
2. Solve the corners using setup moves and R2 turns.

## 4x4 Edge Solving Origin

In December 2005, Stefan Pochmann posted to the Blindfold Solving Rubikâ€™s Cube Yahoo group a technique for solving the edges of the 4x4x4 puzzle. The idea was to use UBr and URf as buffer positions, set up an edge position, then use R U R' U' r U R U' r' and its inverse to solve edges. Pochmann had yet to reveal this new way of solving the edges. As a test of the potential of the idea, Pochmann created a thread in the Yahoo group asking others how long it takes them to solve the edges of the 4x4x4 sighted using a blindsolving method [1]. After several responses Pochmann revealed this new edge solving idea [2]. Eventually the technique was changed from the use of inner slice quarter turns to half turns. After additional development, the moves were changed to a form such as U L' U' r2 U L U' with DFr being used as the buffer position [3].

## Application to 3x3

After developing the 4x4x4 edge solving technique, Pochmann realized that it could be used on the 3x3x3. In January 2022, Pochmann started a thread in the same Yahoo with a similar premise to the 4x4 edge solving thread [4]. This time Pochmann challenged others to do sighted blindfold 3x3 edge solves. In one response to the thread, Pochmann revealed that he had a new method in development. Around a month later Pochmann teased the new idea by responding to someone asking for blindsolving advice, suggesting an edge solving solution that used setups in combination with M2 turns [5].

## M2 Reveal

On February 24 2006, Pochmann fully revealed the new 3x3 blindfold edge solving idea [6]. The method was simply called M2 after the move that the method is based on. At this point the R2 corner solving method had yet to be developed or published.

## R2 Reveal and M2/R2 Completion

In February 2007 Pochmann mentioned that he had been working on R2, a corner solving method to accompany M2 [7]. On June 3 2007 Pochmann added both M2 and R2 to his website, completing the development of M2/R2 as a blindfold solving method [8].

## Interesting Coincidence

After the reveal of the M2 edge solving method, Erik Akkersdjik had the idea to apply it to the 4x4 for solving the edges [9, 10]. This brought everything full circle since the original idea Pochmann had was to use the r2 technique for solving the 4x4 edges then he translated it to the 3x3 edges.

## Advanced M2

The blindfold solving community eventually added techniques from the 3-Style method to M2/R2. Most significant is the use of algorithms to solve two pieces at a time using the DF edge as the buffer. Pochmann himself partially explored this idea, with a post on SpeedSolving.com mentioning the use of commutators for the worst cases of the solve [11].

## Sources

Pochmann himself describes the history of M2/R2 on the page for the method [3]. That served as a starting point for research for this page.
