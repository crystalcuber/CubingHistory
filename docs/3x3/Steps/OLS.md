# OLS

## Description

OLS is a collection of systems for orienting the last layer while solving the final corner and edge pair of the first two layers.

## Vandenberg-Harris Last Slot

### Description

![](img/OLS/VHLSTypes.png)

VHLS orients all edges of the last layer when the final F2L pair is already built on the last layer or when the pair is in the three turns away from solved state (R U R' or F' U' F).

### Origin

VHLS was proposed in October, 2003 on the Speed Solving Rubik's Cube Yahoo group by Lars Vandenberg and Dan Harris.

## Winter Variation

### Description

![](img/OLS/WVType.png)

Winter Variation orients all last layer corners when the final F2L pair is in the pre-built state.

### Origin

Winter Variation was proposed in January, 2005 on the Speed Solving Rubik's Cube Yahoo group by Lucas Winter.

## CLS

### Description

![](img/OLS/CLSType.png)

CLS orients the last layer corners while placing the final corner of the first two layers. The prerequisite is that the last layer edges are already oriented and the final F2L edge is already solved. This was proposed as the second step of MGLS.

### Origin

Shotaro Makisumi and Lucas Garron developed CLS from 2004 - 2007.[<sup>1</sup>][1]

## Erik Johnson Last Slot

### Description

![](img/OLS/EJLSType.png)

EJLS orients the last layer corners when there is a single misoriented corner in the first two layers and the last layer edges are already oriented. It is similar to the "I" and "Im" subsets of CLS. However, the difference is that the goal is to take advantage of easy situations in blockbuilding in Petrus, ZZ, or even CFOP where a corner can be placed misoriented at any point and save moves versus correctly solving the corner.

### Origin

Erik Johnson proposed EJLS on speedsolving.com in September, 2008.[<sup>2</sup>][2] [<sup>3</sup>][3]

## Summer Variation

### Description

![](img/OLS/SVType.png)

Summer Variation orients the last layer corners when all edges are already oriented and the final F2L pair is in the three turns away from solved state (R U R').

### Origin

Chester Lian proposed the Summer Variation on speedsolving.com in January, 2009.[<sup>4</sup>][4]

## Valk's Last Slot and Hessler's Last Slot

### Description

![](img/OLS/SVType.png)

VLS orients the last layer edges and corners when the final F2L pair is pre-built. HLS orients the last layer pieces when the pair is R U R' away from solved.

### Origin

VLS was proposed by Mats Valk in 2009. HLS was proposed by Rowe Hessler in 2013.[<sup>5</sup>][5]

## Magic Wondeful

### Description

![](img/OLS/MWType.png)

Magic Wondeful orients all last last layer pieces when there is an oriented 1x2x2 block of pieces on the last layer and the final F2L pair is pre-built.

### Origin

David Gomes, Jeremy Fleischman, and Devin Corr-Robinett developed the idea in 2011 and it was presented on Shotaro Makisumi's website.[<sup>6</sup>][6] [<sup>7</sup>][7] [<sup>8</sup>][8]

## Brooks Last Edge / Jack Johnston Last Slot

### Description

![](img/OLS/BLE-JJLSType.png)

BLE / JJLS orients all last layer corners during insertion of the final F2L edge. The prerequisite is that the corner of the final F2L pair is already solved, all edges are already oriented, and the edge of the F2L pair is currently in the last layer.

### Origin

#### Jack Johnston and Michael Gottlieb

Jack Johnston proposed the idea in August, 2013 and Michael Gottlieb developed the algorithms.[<sup>9</sup>][9] [<sup>10</sup>][10] [<sup>11</sup>][11]

![](img/OLS/BLE-JJLS3.png)

After development, Johnston presented JJLS to the community in September, 2013.[<sup>12</sup>][12]

#### Anthony Brooks

In 2014, Anthony Brooks independently proposed and developed the first two layer edge placement and last layer corner orientation step of JJLS.[<sup>13</sup>][13] [<sup>14</sup>][14]
