## Description

2GLL solves the last layer in one step when the edges are oriented and the corners are correctly permuted.

**Proposer:** [Bernard Helmstetter](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#helmstetter-bernard)

**Proposed:** 2000.

## Development

### Petrus Method

In 1981, Lars Petrus developed the [Petrus method](3x3/Methods/Petrus.md). Upon reaching the last layer, the first step is to permute the corners [1]. The next two steps orient the corners then permute the edges [2].

### Bernard Helmstetter

Around the year 2000, Bernard Helmstetter generated all of the algorithms to combine the last two steps of the Petrus method [3]. This created a step that orients the four corners while permuting the four edges.

### Lars Petrus

Petrus eventually developed the algorithm set as well and placed it on the Petrus website [4]. On this page, Petrus links to Helmstetterâ€™s website with the original algorithm list.

## Name Origin

The acronym 2GLL was created by Timothy Sun in July, 2007. Sun posted a message to twistypuzzles.com using the acronym and explaining what it stands for [5, 6].
