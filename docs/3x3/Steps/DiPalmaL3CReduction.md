<AnimCube params="config=../../ExhibitConfig.txt&facelets=ryoyyyyybwwwwwwwwwybbbbbbbbygggggggggooooooooyrrrrrrrr" width="400px" height="400px" />

A collection of L3C reduction strategies proposed by [Matt DiPalma](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#dipalma-matt).

## Speed-Heise

Speed-Heise was first proposed in December, 2014 on the Italian site speedcubing.it [1].

Two versions of Speed-Heise were added to DiPalma's blog in March, 2015. One was called Simplified [2] and the other was called Complete [3].

## Tripod Supplement

In March, 2015 DiPalma developed the algorithms for the Tripod method to permute all edges and solve the DFR corner [4].

## Cardan Reduction

In March, 2017 DiPalma proposed Cardan Reduction [5].

## CR†

CR† was proposed in the same post as Cardan Reduction [5].

## SIMPLE

SIMPLE was proposed in August, 2017 [6].

## Early Developments

In July, 2012, DiPalma posted a couple of messages to speedsolving.com that may have been the start of DiPalma's exploration of L3C ideas [7, 8].
