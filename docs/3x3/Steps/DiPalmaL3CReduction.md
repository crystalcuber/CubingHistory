# DiPalma L3C Reduction

A collection of L3C reduction strategies proposed by [Matt DiPalma](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#dipalma-matt).

## Speed-Heise

Speed-Heise was first proposed in December, 2014 on the Italian site speedcubing.it.[<sup>1</sup>][1]

Two versions of Speed-Heise were added to DiPalma's blog in March, 2015. One was called Simplified[<sup>2</sup>][2] and the other was called Complete[<sup>3</sup>][3].

## Tripod Supplement

In March, 2015 DiPalma developed the algorithms for the Tripod method to permute all edges and solve the DFR corner.[<sup>4</sup>][4]

## Early Developments

In July, 2012, DiPalma posted a couple of messages to speedsolving.com that may have been the start of DiPalma's exploration of L3C ideas.[<sup>7</sup>][7] [<sup>8</sup>][8]
