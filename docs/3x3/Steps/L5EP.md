## L5EP 4U + 1D

### First Development

L5EP was first proposed by Mike Bennett in December, 2005 on the Speed Solving Rubik's Cube Yahoo group. Mike Bennet developed the algorithms and placed them on a website in January, 2006.[<sup>1</sup>][1]

### Other Developments and Popularity

#### Second Development

In mid-2006, Michael James Straughan independently had the same idea and developed the algorithms for use in the MI1 method.[<sup>2</sup>][2]

#### Popularity

In 2008 Kennth Gustavsson developed a naming system for each case.[<sup>3</sup>][3] [<sup>4</sup>][4] Within Kenneth's thread, Straughan developed and posted an arrow-based representation image using Kenneth's naming scheme and the algorithms previously developed by Straughan.[<sup>5</sup>][5] [<sup>6</sup>][6] The image and the wiki page helped L5EP gain some popularity, eventually making its way into various methods. Some example methods include ZZ-Portico, Hawaiian Kociemba, Mehta, and Squall.

#### Alternate Naming Scheme

An alternate set of names for each case was developed by Andrew Mahovich and Cubingcubecuber.[<sup>7</sup>][7] [<sup>8</sup>][8]
