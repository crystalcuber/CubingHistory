## Description

OLLCP is a method for solving the last layer.

**Proposer:** [Masayuki Akimoto](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#akimoto-masayuki), others

**Proposed:** Early 2000s.

**Steps:**

1. Solve the last layer corners and orient all last layer edges.
2. Permute the last layer edges.

## Origin

### Masayuki Akimoto

The first known mention of OLLCP is in February 2005 [^1]. Masayuki Akimoto was in the process of generating the algorithms [^2] [^3].

### Kenneth Gustavsson

In the mid-2000s, Kenneth Gustavsson started working on OLLCP as well [^4] [^5] [^6]. Gustavsson's name for the algorithm set was XCLL.

### Thom Barlow

In 2011, Thom Barlow developed a version of OLLCP that uses combinations of short algorithms to solve each case [^7] [^8].

## Name

As seen in the initial proposals, Gustavsson had given the algorithm set the name XCLL. It was around 2010 that the community began calling it OLLCP [^9] [^10].
