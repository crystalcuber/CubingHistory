## Description

**Proposer:** [Joseph Briggs](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#briggs-joseph-shadowslice)

**Proposed:** 2015

**Steps:**

1. Build a 1x2x3 block on the left side.
2. Build a 2x2x2 block at dbr and add the FR edge and DFR corner twisted in any orientation.
3. Recognize all remaining pieces and execute L5C and L5E in either order.

## Origin

### Development

The origin of the method may be traced to another method proposal by Joseph Briggs [1]. A little over a week before proposing M-CELL, Briggs posted a similar method idea. The idea was to reach the F2L-1 state by building a 1x2x3 block, adding a 2x2x2 block, then adding a final edge. The finish was to orient all edges then use Winter Variation and PLL.

### Proposal

The previous idea was refined into a more unique method. M-CELL was proposed on August 21, 2015 [2].
