>I contacted Georges Helm to ask the method steps in all of the books he owns from 1980 and earlier. This is a handwritten list of steps. "K" is for edges and "E" is for corners. The numbers on the left indicate the bottom, middle, and upper layer. "P" is for "position" and "O" is for "orient". Donald Taylor's publication is the earliest of the books he owns that describes Layer By Layer.

>The steps are: Edges of first layer, corners of the first layer, edges of the middle layer, permute the last layer corners, permute the last layer edges, orient the last layer corners, orient the last layer edges. These same steps are also described in *Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube'*.
