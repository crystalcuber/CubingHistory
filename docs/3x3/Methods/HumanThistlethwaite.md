# Human Thistlethwaite

## Description

**Proposer:** [Ryan Heise](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#heise-ryan)

**Proposed:** 2002

**Steps:**

1. Reduce the cube to the move group \<U, D, L, R, F2, B2>. This means to orient all edges along the z axis.
2. Reduce to the \<U, D, L2, R2, F2, B2> move group. U/D layer edges are moved to U/D and all corners are oriented to U/D.
3. Reduce to the \<U2, D2, L2, R2, F2, B2> move group. The corners are permuted to have opposite stickers on all sides and all edges are moved to their native inner layers.
4. Permute all pieces using the \<U2, D2, L2, R2, F2, B2> move group.

A couple of weeks later, in July, 2003, Heise described the steps and process.

### Website Addition

In late April or early May, 2006, Heise added the method to his website. The website states that the method was created in December of 2002.
