## Description

**Proposer:** [Michael James Straughan](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#straughan-michael-james-athefre)

**Proposed:** 2010

**Steps:**

1. Orient all edges while solving a line of edges at FL and BL. This step is called EOLine.
2. Build a 1x2x3 block of oriented pieces on both the bottom and upper layer.
3. Orient the remaining corners while placing the FR and BR edges.
4. Permute all corners and edges.

## Origin

### Development

In late 2009, Michael James Straughan began experimenting with combining the EOLine step of ZZ with Corners First. The result was a method that solved all corners after EOLine, then the permutation of all remaining edges [1, 2].

MI2 was placed on Straughan's first website. This website wasn't preserved well on archive.org and only the main page remains archived [3].

In October, 2011 Straughan discovered the oriented blockbuilding concept and incorporated it into MI2 [4]. This set the steps of the method to what they are now.
