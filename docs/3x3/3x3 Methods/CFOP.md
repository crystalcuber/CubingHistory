# CFOP

## Description

**Proposer:** Various

**Proposed:** 1979 - 1981

**Steps:**

1. Cross: Solve the four bottom layer edges.
2. First Two Layers (F2L): Solve the four corner and edge pairs around the bottom two layers.
3. Orient the Last Layer (OLL): Orient all pieces of the upper layer.
4. Permute the Last Layer (PLL): Permute all pieces of the upper layer.

## First Two Layers

The first known publication of the corner and edge pairing technique appeared in 1979. John Conway, David Seal, and David Benson developed algorithms for all possible cases and published in two different publications.
