# APB

[APB Website](https://sites.google.com/view/apb-system)

## Description

**Proposer:** James Straughan

**Proposed:** 2021

**Steps:**

1. First Block (FB): Solve a 1x2x3 block on the left side.
2. F2L Minus Square: Solve the remainder of the F2L minus the dfR square.
3. Edge Orientation (EO): Orient all remaining edges.
4. Last Extended Slot (LXS): Solve the final square of the first two layers using a single algorithm.
5. Last Layer (LL): Solve the last layer.

## Origin

APB started from the thought that the EO step of Petrus should be simultaneously accomplishing something other than only edge orientation.

I wasn't a Petrus user, contrary to what the wording may convey. I had been experimenting with the methods available at the time in 2005 - 2006. Petrus was one method that I had tried out a lot. So in January - February 2006 I came to the conclusion that the edge orientation step almost felt like a waste, and I ultimately chose Roux.

In 2021, I started a discussion in the Petrus channel of the r/cubers Discord server. The discussion was about adding something to the edge orientation step of the Petrus method.
