# 42

## Description

**Proposer:** Joseph Briggs

**Proposed:** 2017

**Steps:**

1. CPLine: Solve the 1x1x3 line at DL while permuting all corners of the cube along the z axis. Afterward, the corners are solvable using turns of just the U and R layers.
2. Extend the 1x1x3 line into a 2x2x3 block at dl while orienting all edges along the z axis.
3. Complete the first two layers by solving the 1x2x3 block at dR.
4. Solve the last layer.
