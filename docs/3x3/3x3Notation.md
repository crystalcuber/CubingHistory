# APB

## Description

**Proposer:** [Michael James Straughan](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#straughan-michael-james-athefre)

**Proposed:** 2021

**Steps:**

1. First Block (FB): Solve a 1x2x3 block on the left side.
2. F2L Minus Square: Solve the remainder of the F2L minus the dfR square.
3. Edge Orientation (EO): Orient all remaining edges.
4. Last Extended Slot (LXS): Solve the final square of the first two layers using a single algorithm.
5. Last Layer (LL): Solve the last layer.

Originally, the steps of APB involved solving a 2x2x3 block, setting up a pair but not yet solving it, solving the pair while orienting all remaining edges, then LXS and LL. However, in 2024 it was decided to simplify the steps to what they are now.

## Origin

APB started from the thought that the EO step of Petrus should be simultaneously accomplishing something other than only edge orientation.
