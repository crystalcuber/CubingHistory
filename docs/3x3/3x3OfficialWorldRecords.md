# Official World Records

## World Cube Association

### Origin

Before the formation of the World Cube Association, the landscape of world records was a sort of wild west. Many claimed to be the real world record holder - some with absurdly low solving time claims - and keeping track of the records was close to impossible.

In 2004, the World Cube Association was formed by Ron van Bruchem and Tyson Mao. Initially the name of the organization was "World Rubik's Cube Association", but was later changed to its current name.

### Competition Format

1982 champs format plus new additions such as Fridrich's average of 10 or 12 minus best and worst solve.

## First Official Competitions

## Rubik's Cube World Championship (1982)

The first officially recognized competition is the Rubik's Cube World Championship held in 1982. Although there were many small and large competitions held before this one, the 1982 championship was likely chosen as the first official one due to the presence of many high profile names and organizers, such as Ern≈ë Rubik and David Sinmaster, the competition being highly organized and filmed, and its bringing together of competitors from around the world.

The competition was held on June 5, 1982. Competitors from various countries were chosen. In order to qualify, a competitor must have been able to solve the cube in under one minute (Newsweek, Rubikmania: Lots of New Twists, April 19, 1982, pg 16).
