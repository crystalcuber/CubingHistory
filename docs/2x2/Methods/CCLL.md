## Description

**Proposer:** [Michael James Straughan](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#straughan-michael-james-athefre), [Joseph Briggs](CubingContributors/MethodDevelopers.md#briggs-joseph-shadowslice)

**Proposed:** 2012

**Steps:**

1. Solve the four bottom layer corners with one corner offset and a U layer corner attached.
2. Solve the four upper layer corners relative to the U layer corner on the bottom layer then undo the pseudo state.

## Origin and Development

Conjugated CLL (CLL) is the placement of a U layer corner on the bottom layer with a D layer corner. The upper layer corners are now in a pseudo state and are solved relative to the U layer corner that was placed on the bottom layer.

This concept was first developed by Michael James Straughan in 2012 [1].

In 2018, Joseph Briggs independently proposed the same concept as an application of the 42 method to the 2x2x2.
