        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI hope this group continues to grow as I would really like to see this\nmethod become mainstream one day in the future, assuming is has the\npotential of course.\n\nHere is how I have learned what I know of ZB so far.  It has worked\nfor me, but I don't know if it is the best way.  I would like this\nthread to be a discussion of the most efficient way to learn ZB.\n\nI guess this of course assumes you already know all of OLL and PLL. \nOr at the very very least all of PLL.\n\nVery first beginnings:\nI guess at the very start I learned the COLL algs before anything\nelse.  COLL recognition is such a core part of ZBLL recognition, that\nI think it is very important to learn these very early on.\n\nMoving on:\nAfter COLL I moved on to ZBF2L algs.  I was basing off Macky's quote\nthat \"It's all about F2L\" and I think for ZB it will most definitely\nbe true that \"It's all about ZBF2L\" in terms of whether a solve is a\ngood solve or not.  I've known the ZBF2L algs now for 8 months and I\nam starting to see the intuition on all but the most obscure cases.  I\nthink my ZBF2L is fairly fast, though still needs lots of improvement,\nand is probably only about 2 seconds slower than my Fridrich F2L, and\non a good ZB average (sub-17) probably only 1 second or less.\n\nMoving on from ZBF2L:\nOk so I saved ZBLL for last since it is so ridiculously huge.  I am\nlearning this by orientation cases with COLL cases as subgroups within\nan orientation case.  I like this way since you can practice the algs\nby learning the transformation algs from your unknown OLL case into a\nknown OLL case.  I think this aids with learning, but is probably not\nthe most optimal way for maximizing your speed while learning.  I\nthink optimally you should take your slowest COLL case and learn all\nthe ZBLL algs for it.  Then move on to your next slowest, until you\nknow all 40 COLL cases.\n\n---------\n\nSide notes:\nI think OLL, although not necessary for true ZB, should be required\nfor learning ZB.  I've found that sometimes I can use a multislotting\ntrick to solve the 3rd and 4th corner edge pair very quickly and save\na second or two.  In this situation I would much rather do that, then\nend with OLL and PLL than to solve the 3rd pair only, then hope for a\ngood ZBF2L for the 4th pair, then hope for a ZBLL case that you know.\n\nI think when you know 100% ZBLL this might also still be fast,\nassuming you have a well refined OLL/PLL combo.\n\n----------------\n\nI have no idea if this is the most efficient way, but I like the\nability to know just based on orientation whether or not I know a\ncase.  For example if I see the T orientation I know immediately that\nI can do ZBLL.  If I see the \"L\" I know I don't know any algs for it\nand would just use COLL/PLL.\n\nI think having your ZBLL algs spread out over different OLL cases by\nlearning your slowest COLL case would probably be faster in the long\nrun, but would take my skill with recognition when first starting with\nZBLL.\n\nAlso I think COLL/PLL is a bad idea for COLL cases you don't know.  It\ncan be fast, and the 1/12 PLL skip is nice, but some of the algs are\nso horribly slow for COLL.  I think maybe using only fast COLL cases\nwould be the best idea.  The rest of the time you could just do OLL/PLL.\n\nAnyone have any opinions here?\n\n----------------\n\nLet's try to figure out the best way to learn this method.  I really\ndon't feel that the number of ZBLL algs is too many, even for\nrecognition.  However, in terms of learning them I think there must be\nbetter ways to approach it than others.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Pretty quickly though\nI adopted a technique that worked very well for me, and let me average\nalmost 2.5 algs per day.\n\nWithin each ZBF2L case there are 8 edge cases (fewer for nicely\nsymmetric F2L cases).\n\nHere is how you can approach an F2L case (all 8 subcases) and learn\nthem in three days or less and average 2.5-4 algs per day for learning.\n\nDay 1:\nLook at all 8 algs for your chosen F2L case.  Do them over an over\nagain on your cube.  Don't just do the alg, but set up with the\ninverse of the solving alg so each time you see the case the algs\nsolves.  Concentrate today only on how to differentiate each case from\nthe other 7.  Give them names, or associate them with a picture.  Just\nbe able to know how to \"see\" each case today.  Try to setup and solve\neach alg 20 times or so.\n\nDay 2:\nAgain try to do each alg about 20 times by setting it up and then\nsolving it.  Today though, focus on memorizing the first 2-3 moves of\neach alg.  You should already comfortably be able to diffentiate them,\nnow just associate with each case the first say 2 moves of the alg to\nsolve it.  Remember to do each alg 20 times at least though still.\n\nDay 3:\nStill do each alg 20 times each at least, but now focus on each alg\nindividually and associate with your already memorized first 2-3 moves\nwith the rest of the alg.  So once you have done the first 2-3 moves\nyou will be able to recall the rest of the alg.  After having done\neach case at least 60 times already this is easier than it sounds.\n\nNow you know all 8 cases fairly solidly within 3 days (sometimes 2). \nThat's a 2.5 algs per day rate.  You will be able to recall the algs\non a speedsolve but you might delay up to 10-20 seconds or more to\nrecall it.  You will, however, retain all 8.\n\nAfter 2-3 weeks you will recognize each case fairly quickly in a\nspeedsolve with minimal delay.\n\nAfter 1 month on average for me, I could recognize all 8 cases within\nan F2L case extremely smoothly with hardly any delay other than the\noccasional amnesia.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For each ZBLL case I use ACube to find algs in\nthe metrics I like.  I usually search for quarter turn optimal algs in\nthe [RUL] group or [RUF] group first.  I have ACube display all algs,\nnot just optimal cases.\n\nThen I have ACube search for all algs with all available moves and I\nhave it display all algs found, not just optimal cases.\n\nThen I sift through the huge lists of algs to find the good ones (most\nare easily recognizable as horrible algs for speedcubing).\n\nI then get down to 2-3 algs that are very nice.  I then use Netcube to\ntime each alg.  I don't memorize the algs I just read them off and\ntime my execution of each one.  After 20-30 repeitions you can do each\nof the 2-3 algs without reading off the ACube printout since they are\nin very short term memory.  Play with each alg and find the one that\nseems to be the fastest.\n\nNow that you have chosen an alg, do it 30-40 more times and time each\ntrial with ACube.  By this point it is fairly well in your short term\nmemory.  Then before you go to bed do the alg a few times again and by\nthen you will have it memorized fairly well and can use it in speedsolves.\n\nIt usually takes ACube a day to a day and a half to find algs, then I\nspend either the second half day or full day trying to find the best\nalg and learn it.  So for ZBLL I average about 2 days per alg.  For\nyou guys learning from either my or Dan's site I imagine you can learn\nfaster since you can skip the alg searching phase.\n\nI've found that often I really dislike the Bernard Helmstetter algs,\nso I will continue to generate all of mine with ACube.\n\nIf anyone is interested I can post the results for each case, or at\nleast the algs that I sift through to be the best ones.  I don't have\nthe files for most of the T cases, but I do for the last 1 or 2 COLL\ncases as well as all the U cases I know so far.\n\nLet me know if you're interested in this fairly good algs.  People\nhave different styles, so I may have weeded out an alg that you would\nhave kept though, so these lists might still not be optimal for your\nhands.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nFor a while I had been debating on what the best way to learn ZB would\nbe; if it would be better to learn ZBF2L then ZBLL, or learn ZBLL then\nZBF2L.  I think I've come up with a pretty good way to do both though,\nand I'm going to try using it from now on.\n\nI know about 40 ZBF2L algs so far.  Going by Chris' ZBF2L page, I know\nall of cases 1, 2, 3, 5, and 13 (including reflections).  I can\nconvert any case that I don't know into case 1 or 13 very easily, and\nthe ones that aren't easy to convert I know the ZBF2L cases for\n(excluding case 4, which I'll learn next).  So, I can use ZBF2L on\nevery solve without too much extra effort.  I feel I can use this to\nmy advantage to start working on ZBLL now.  It seems pointless to\nstart ZBLL without knowing any of ZBF2L, but if I can use ZBF2L on\nevery solve even without knowing that many cases, then why not start\nlearning ZBLL?  At the same time though, I don't want to completely\nabandon learning ZBF2L algs.  So here's what I've decided to do.  For\nZBF2L, I'm going to use Chris' technique of spreading each case out\nover a three day time span and learning them all on the third day.  At\nthe same time though, I will try and learn one ZBLL each day.  So, for\napproximately every 8 ZBF2L algs, I will learn 3 ZBLL algs.  I think\nthis should be completely managable, and this is nice because by the\ntime I'm done learning ZBF2L, I'll already have a decent chunk of ZBLL\ndown (about 1 1/2 orientation cases).  With practice, I think that one\nZBLL case per day is very doable, and Chris has already proven that\nhis 3 day ZBF2L method works fine, so why not combine the two?\n\nOf course, if this does prove to be too much, I will try a different\nlearning method.  However, this sounds like a nice way to focus both\non ZBF2L and ZBLL without overloading your brain.\n\nLet me know what you guys think!\n\n-Jason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I only know the T, so I had to\nset it up with a transformation if it wasn't already a T case after ZBF2L.\n\nFor solves that were already the T orientation after ZBF2L I tried to\nstart from a random angle, and when I needed to do a transformation\ninto T I did the transformation without looking then started the timer\nwhen I first saw each case.  So basically these averages include the\nrecognition time for ZBLL as well.\n\n05.50, 05.99, 05.35, 05.25, 04.98, 06.58, (03.22), (07.97), 07.12,\n06.67, 05.64, 6.56 = 5.96\n\n05.34, 09.58, 04.88, 06.94, 05.50, 05.29, (09.94), 05.11, 06.83,\n04.36, 05.05, (03.04) = 5.89\n\nThat's actually pretty good for me even if I was doing Fridrich LL.  I\nhad some long delays on the case 6 algs for my ZBLL T algs since I\nrecently learned them.  I think in 6 months when I know all the T algs\nsecond nature that I can easily get sub-5 on average.  So I think a\nsub-5 average is possible for ZBLL algs that you know very well. \nMaybe after 2-3 years of knowing ZBLL that could even get to low 4.xx,\nwho knows?  With all easy cases I think a sub-4 might be possible,\nthough those types of averages would be infrequent.\n\nAnyway I thought this was promising, since it shows that even with\ndelays on cases that I recently learned, I can get times that compare\nto a fairly good Fridrich LL average (for me).\n\nI think ZBLL will definitely be managable, even with recognition.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Open up the command window by clicking on \"start\",\nthen \"run\", then type in \"command\" and click on \"OK\"\n\nIf you don't use windows then get to a place where you can run a java\nprogram from a command screen.\n\nIn the windows command program you have to change directories to where\nyour files are for ACube using the tradional DOS directory commands.\n\nOnce you get to the right directory, type in this\n\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube\n\nNow after that line you have a few options for attributes.  You can\nhave the program search in either face turn metric, slice turn metric,\nor quarter turn metric.  Your other options are to search for optimal\nlength algs or algs of any length, and also for the program to print\nout every alg it finds or only a small portion.\n\nThe commands I use to search for ZBLL algs are these:\n\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube q a\n\nThe \"q\" means to search in quartern turn metrics and the \"a\" means\nprint out every single alg.\n\nOnce I've analyzed the positions in that metric I exit the program\nwith \"Ctrl + C\" and start it again with\n\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube a\n\nThis searches in face turn metric (face turn is the default) and\nprints out every alg it finds.\n\nI then compare the best quarter turn algs and best face turn algs and\ntry to find the best alg among those.  If you are comfortable with\nslice moves, which I am not, then you would also want to use this\nsearch string\n\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube s a\n\n--------------\n\nOnce in ACube you have to decide which types of turns you want to\nallow, and you have to input the position.\n\nWhile in quarter turn searching (java -cp ACube3.jar ACube q a) I\noften start with searching for [RUL] only algs.  To do this I have to\ncome up with the octet that represents R U and L only.\n\nThe order of the faces is UDFBLRESM\n\nI only want to allow R U and L so I would go through and put a \"0\" on\nthe face I don't want to allow and a \"1\" on the one I do want to allow.\n\nUDFBLRESM\n100011000\n\nNow break this up into three groups of three numbers.  100 011 000 and\nconvert each group of three numbers to decimal.  100 = 4 in decimal. \n011 = 3 in decimal.  and 000 = 0 in decimal.\n\nNow put those numbers together and you get 430\n\nSo to search for RUL only moves type \"430\" then a space then the cube\nposition.  I also like to do RULM moves which is 431 by the same process.\n\nNow you have to input the cube state.  I'll input the T-orientation\ncase ZBLL alg that has all corners in the correct spot and the edges\nare in the H permutation.\n\nSo UBR is rotated counter-clockwise, UBL is rotated clockwise, UF and\nUB switch, and UR and UL switch.\n\nIn ACube this is:\nUB UL UF UR !! ! -UBR +UBL !!\n\nThe edges are in the order UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL\nand the corners are in the order UFR UBR UBL UFL DFR DFL DBL DBR\n\nThe \"!!\" is short for everything past the last entry is in the correct\nspot and oriented correctly.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nEver since I started I've been using COLL/EPLL (edge PLL) for ZBLL\ncases I don't know.  I think COLL/PLL is slower than OLL/PLL though,\nso I've been working on that lately.\n\nIt's hard to get used to, but I think with time it will be faster. \nThe problem is your chance for 1 look LL changes dramatically between\nthe two.\n\nIn order for a EPLL skip to count as non-lucky for speedcubing.com you\nhave to have a 20% or greater chance to skip the step you skipped.\n\nFor COLL/PLL the 1/12 chance to skip EPLL helps tremendously.  However\nif you change that to the odds for OLL or PLL skip then things change.\n\nHere are the numbers for how many ZBLL algs you have to know in order\nto count your skips as non-lucky for COLL/PLL and OLL/PLL\n\nCOLL/PLL\n(1/27) + (4/27)*(x/72) + (22/27)*(1/12) = 0.2\nx = 46.2 or 47.\n\nSo you have to know basically 4 COLL cases and use all the PLL and\nCOLL/PLL on any case you don't know.\n\nOLL/PLL\n(1/27) + (4/27)*(x/72) + (22/27)*[(1/27)*(71/72) + (26/27)*(1/72) +\n(1/27)*(1/72)] = 0.2\n\nx = 59.24 or 60\n\nSo you have to know 60 ZBLL algs or 5 full COLL cases in order for\nOLL/PLL step skip solves to be non-lucky for speedcubing.com\n\nThe only reason I say this is that you will start to get skip solves a\nlot that are faster than your pb solves with Fridrich.  In order to\ncount those on speedcubing.com though, you have to use the above\nstrategies at the right time.\n\nThis assumes you know all ZBF2L.  At 4 COLL cases use COLL/PLL on\n*every* ZBLL case you don't know and any skip solve that was\npreviously lucky now counts for speedcubing.com lists.\n\nAfter 5 full COLL cases you can use OLL/PLL on any COLL case you don't\nknow and still have your skip solves count for speedcubing.com\n\nJust some ways to stay motivated along the way :-D\n\nSo benchmark #1 is 4 COLL cases to have non lucky skip step solves. \nThen benchmark #2 is to get to 5 COLL cases so that you can switch to\nOLL/PLL which is faster, and still have skip step solves non-lucky.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sure, the\nrecognition time will be slightly more, but there's only one\nrecognition period.  For OLL/PLL, there are two.

I can\nonly do this to cases where a single or double U turn fixes them.\n\nHowever, because I don't know the Bruno COLL cases, and I've only just\nlearned the Double Sune cases, it's very helpful to see when the LL\ncorners will come out all incorrectly oriented, and be able to switch\nthem to a different case.  Most times, if I can't get a full OLL skip\nout of it, I can at least transform into either the L or T shapes,\nwhich all of my algs for are very fast.  Again, this generally only\nadds 2 or so turns to a solve, and gives a much better LL.\n \n> > \n> > I'm also curious how difficult it would be to try to always fix corner\n> > permutation during the last pair.

I've realized\nthat simple U turns alone can't accomplish this, because they leave\nthe corner permutation unaffected, only changing the orientation.  I\nknow there should be a simple way to do this, but I can't for the life\nof me figure out how.\n\n> \n> That would take fewer algs than ZB, and I imagine it would be pretty\n> fast.

That should be R U2 R' U'.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting much better at fixing or altering corner\norientation with the last F2L pair.  Right now, I can really only use\nit to fix similar cases to the above, and to change cases with four\nincorrectly oriented corners to cases with fewer (which I know\nbetter).  I know that there are simple ways to expand upon this, such\nas the setup RU2R'U'RUR'U'.  You can fix it with the inverse, which is\nvery quick.  I know there are probably similar ways to speed up other\ncases, but I haven't tried to find any yet.\n\nUsing this, I managed an 18.40 average earlier, beating my previous\nbest average by almost 1 second.  I don't know if there are more cases\nit's easy to fix this way, but I'm curious what the odds to skip the\nOLL step entirely improve to.  I'm wondering if anything more than\nwhat I'm using already is worthwhile in terms of moves or time saved.\n\nI know that without this, the odds are something like 1/27, or ~3.7%.\n Added to the 1/12 (8.33%)chance for skipping PLL, that's just over\n12% chances for a skipped step every solve.  I know this improves the\nodds slightly, but I'd like to know how much.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on how to fix corner permutation instead I'd\nlike to hear them, as well.\n\n-Mike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We all invade the sunday contest every sunday,\nand we use however much zb techniques we know.  This is great practice\nto time yourself with the new techniques.  I mean go all out, make\nmistakes, try new things with the timer still going, etc.\n\nI've found that knowing ZBLL and ZBF2L and speedsolving ZBLL and ZBF2L\nare two entirely different things, so I think starting early on timing\nwould be a good thing.\n\nAlso, this would be a good chance for us to motivate eachother to\nlearn more.  We can share tips afterward, talk through solves on this\ngroup etc..\n\nAlso having people see our progress on the sunday contest over time\nmay motivate others to try.\n\nSo remember, if you want to work on your zb, do the sunday contest and\nat the end of your quote but something [zb] or ZB or whatever to show\nthat is what you used.\n\nBob and I will be doing this for this week's sunday contest and we\nwould love for everyone to join in!\n\nUse whatever you know, even if it's no much!

Bascailly it entails using the COLL case to identify\nwhether or not your have double parity or just single parity whenever\nyou see the OLL parity.\n\nI'm going to complete all the orientation pages and COLL images on my\nZBLL page in order to use it as a study aid.\n\nI will continue to only add the actual algorithms as I learn them.  I\nreally only post an alg once I know it through and through, so that\nwon't change.\n\nIf you're interested in this method, let me know and I can explain\nmore about it.  ZB is what gave me the idea to try it, and since\nworking out better solutions to the parity algs is the hot topic for\n4x4x4 solving right now I want to pursue it pretty hard myself.\n\nSo ZB helps for other cubes, not just the 3x3x3.\n\nThe advantage to using the \"one-parity\" method is also that ZBLL\nbecomes a viable option on 4x4x4 since you can be certain of a true\nZBLL case without parity.\n\nSomething to think about if you're interested in using your new ZB\nstuff to help for the larger cubes as well.\n\nChris\nteam [zb]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some solves were straight ZB, some were fast\nCOLL.  The 16.20 at the very end was a straight ZB solve, I knew the\nZBLL case, and I think 1 of the 17's also.\n\nI kind of like this, since some of my COLL cases are horrible, and I\nthink it might be faster to do the transformation then a T alg.\n\nI'm going to mess around with this some more, but even with only\nbeginning to do this I can get sub-19 with it.

I just know that you guys will all be to this point very\nshortly, so I'm trying to mess around with new techniques and\nhopefully you guys will know a really good strategy for handling your\nnon-ZBLL case solves better than COLL/PLL by the time you get her.

        "content": "Hey Matt,\n\nI guess I should have clarified a little more ;-)\n\nCOLL/EPLL is extremely fast, and I think when you factor in the 1/12\nchance to skip EPLL that it might be faster than most people's OLL/PLL\ncombos.  I think a really good OLL/PLL set of algs though would\nprobably win out.\n\nWhat I don't like is getting a slow COLL case, and ending with a Z\npermutation.  As weird as that sounds, and as much as I like the Z\nperm in my solving, it is my slowest and longest EPLL alg.  That\ndouble combination can mean a slow LL time compared to the average\nCOLL/PLL gives you.\n\nOn this page: http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/zbstats.html\n\nI have twice done a 100 cube average that shows the number of moves\nused in COLL/PLL finish.\n\nI get that, including the EPLL skips, COLL/PLL averages 21.12 moves on\naverage.  I think Fridrich averages around 19-20 as well so they are\nfairly close.  The problem though, for me, is that keeping the edges\noriented for some CLL cases means a slow alg.\n\nHaving said that though I have managed sub-17 averages using COLL/PLL\non ZBLL cases that I don't know.  I am certain I have had a full 12\ncube sub-17 average that only had EPLL skips for the ZBLL stuff,\nmeaning that sub-17 is definitely possible.\n\nI don't think a transformation+ZBLL combo used exclusively would be\nfaster, but rather a combination of COLL/PLL finish (only on fast COLL\ncases) and transformation+ZBLL on slow COLL cases would be best.\n\nI think all of COLL should be required before learning any ZBLL\nthough, since the recognition of ZBLL for me is so heavily based on\nCOLL.  I use the block recognition technique for ZBLL, and often the\nonly thing different between three different ZBLL cases is the COLL\ncase.  They can have the same block structure, but be different COLL\ncases.\n\nSo I would definitely say to learn COLL, and use COLL/EPLL until you\nfinish your first orientation case for ZBLL.  After that point,\nreplace your slowest COLL cases with transformations into your ZBLL\norientation.  At least that is the experiment I am trying, but I have\na feeling it has potential to e very fast.\n\nSo when I say slower, I only mean sometimes.  COLL/EPLL is still fast,\nbut I don't think it is the best option.  It is, however, still a good\none.\n\nChris\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, \"mgwallisa\" <mattwallisa@m...> wrote:\n>\n> --- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, \"cmhardw\" <foozman17@h...> wrote:\n>  I\n> > definitely agree with Mike that COLL/EPLL is not a good LL \n> strategy in\n> > the long run, so I'm trying to find new things as well.

As I see it, when you're finishing your last pair, there\nare four possible LL substeps you can accomplish with it.\nOrient edges, as in ZB\nOrient corners\nPermute corners\nPermute edges.  I don't think permuting edges would be very effective,\nbecause you would be left with edge OLL and COLL without disturbing edges.\n\nThis leaves the middle two strategies unexamined.  The latter of which\nwould leave an interesting combination.  Assuming you used ZB cases\n(however many up to you, but at least 1 and 13)to flip edges first, it\nwould basically leave you with an easy ZB case for the remaining step.\n It would be an interesting alternative to ZB, but without quite so\nmuch potential.  Perhaps as an alternative to someone who doesn't want\nto learn full ZB, but wouldn't mind a reduced number of cases.\n\nThe former choice seems more interesting to me.  There are two\npossible ways to pursue this option.  The first involves learning\ncases to orient corners only, seeing as this has the greatest number\nof possible cases concerning these four substeps, it offers the\ngreatest possible rewards for lessening the number of cases for your\nlast step.  If you could orient corners with your last pair, simply\nusing cases 1 and 13 that gives us 27*2*2 cases, accounting for\nsymmetry.  That gives us 108 cases to learn, compared to the 306 for\nZBF2L.  Also this leaves us with an intruiging last layer. \nEssentially, it would give you of the 21 PLL cases, with one of 7\npossible edge orientations.  As far as recognition is concerned, I\nthink it could be quite fast.  The trick would be finding algs that\ndid it quickly.  I'm terrible at finding move counts and whatnot, so I\ndon't know if this would prove to even be an improvement over normal\nCFOP, but I suspect it would be, if only for the reduced number of\nmoves for corner orientation.\n\nAlternately, if one were to perform a ZB case 1 or 13 alg *followed*\nby a corner orienter, this brings your OLL skip percentage to 100%,\nleaving you with a simple PLL for your LL (except in cases where your\nfourth pair is finished after you place your third).  Again, I'm no\nexpert on move counts, but I would assume exploiting an open slot\nwould be useful.  Especially in cases where you've got an easy edge\norientaion, this could be quite fast.  In fact, I got a 14.25 today\nwith it.  Technically I had one pair come up ready to insert and a\nvery easy two move cross, but it was still way faster any of my other\nsolves.  Again, I doubt this will approach full ZB in terms of\npotential, but for those wary of learning several hundred algorithms,\nthis might be a good way to go.  Really, it's got 140 F2L cases and 21\nLL cases.\n\nAnyway, this was all inspired by my foolings with ZB, and may be an\ninteresting path to try.  If anyone wants to work out possible move\nnumbers or percentages and things for me, or explain how, that would\nbe fantastic.\n \n> I don't mean to brag here, I'm not trying to rub in knowing the T\n> orientation.

I\nthink taking stock of your inventory of COLL algs every now and then\nto see which cases are slow and which are fast is a good idea anyway.\n However, if you've already learned all of the T's, now is the time to\ndo it again.  Decide based on the orientation case whether or not\nyou're going to do COLL or just transform to the T case.  In general,\nI think you'd want to stick with COLL, simply because recognizing the\ncase to transform into the T and then a ZB alg on top of that would\nadd incredible odds for delay.\n\n>I definitely agree with Mike that COLL/EPLL is not a good LL strategy in\n> the long run, so I'm trying to find new things as well.

Too ambiguous\nand not beneficial enough.  It's why I decided to go with straight\nCOLL+PLL.  And, at least for me, this is proving far more promising\nthan OLL+PLL.  Since I've started learning them a few months ago, I've\ndropped my best average of 100 down to 19.96.  Then again, I think\nI'll have more luck in the end with COLL+PLL/specialized ZB, but your\nmileage may vary.\n> \n> Chris\n>\n\nMike\nteam [zb]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As you get further on in your solution, edge \ncontrol gets harder and harder, simply because you have less freedom.\n\nRecently I have been experimenting with Orienting edges right at the \nbeginning of the solve. Orienting edges and then solving the cross is \neasy enough to do, but I think you would only reap any benefit from \nthis if you could orient edges AND solve the cross SIMULTANEOUSLY. I \nsuggested to Chris that with a lot of practice, this might be in the \nsame league as solving the XCross, which Chris himself admits he can \nregularly see now given the 15 seconds inspection. I must note that \nthis idea was not fundamentally mine, it was discussing this \npossibility with Ron at WC2005 and also hearing about it sometime in \nthe past that caused me to try and work at it. Really, it's the first \ntime I heard about it and had enough cubing experience to know exactly \nwhat it means for the rest of the solve ;)\n\nOf course, most of you guys are a lot sharper than me, and you would \nprobably realise even now, that if you could have 12correctly oriented \nedges after the cross is solved, you have 2 advantages.\n\nFirstly, you can blaze through the F2L, the number of cases is halved? \n(intuition tells me this but like most things where intuition is \ninvolved ive probably missed a simple counter-example...). But you can \nspeed through it using only R U and L (and D of course, for empty \nslots), and of course F2 and B2 if necessary. You can even use F and B \nif it's easier, as long as the algorithm is 2-generator and you \nreplace the cross edge after solving the pair it won't affect the \nedges!\n\nSecondly, once you've solved the F2L, without any work at all (and \nensuring you haven't changed edge orientation during F2L), you end up \nwith a ZBLL case by default. I realise a lot of people in this group \nare learning ZBF2L, and this would render those 300 or so algs \nredundant. I don't want to \"urinate on your bonfire\" by any means, I \nstill think it is worth learning since my original idea of orienting \nedges is still unproved to work, but this is why I am posting about \nit! But you have to work far less hard to orient edges during the F2L, \nso you could go at it absolutely full speed, and with the ease of the \nalgorithms perhaps even solve it in 5-6 seconds. However I would like \nyou to consider this idea.\n\nSo you would proceed:\nOrient edges + Solve Cross together\nF2L \nZBLL\n\nI am currently learning the ZBLL element which is common to both this \nidea and the full ZB system, so I am not in too far that I can't get \nout yet ;)\n\nI would appreciate some feedback :)\n\nDanH :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Or if it is indeed easier and can be done all the\ntime then that would solve this whole problem.\n\nJust trying to think out loud, I think it is a good idea, but I think\nwe need to refine it a bit too.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently have been having some doubts about ZB, which I would prefer\nnot to be having, but I wanted to bring them up.\n\nI recently met with Dan Knights and asked him what he thought about\nZB.  His response was, for the most part, that it seemed like a good\nmethod but that recognition seems that it would be a big problem.\n\nI also have noticed that I still delay quite a bit using the block\nmethod for my ZBLL cases.\n\nI'm at a dilemma.  I have been talking with lots of people about\nFridrich after the 2005RWC and have found lots of really useful ways\nto drop my average.  I even think now that I could get sub-15 with\nFridrich were I to just implement all the changes that I should implement.\n\nAlso though, I really am curious about the potential for ZB.  I know\nthat if I don't try it out myself, knowing all or at least almost all\nof it, my curiosity of whether or not it is a worthwhile method would\neventually drive me insane.\n\nSo I'm stuck.  I have two methods that both require quite a bit of\nwork to learn/master and only 24 hours in a day.\n\nHow can we balance these methods?  Should I extend my goal to learning\nZB for another year or two and learn at a slower pace, and also\npractice Fridrich half the time?\n\nAlso, after talking with Dan I think we really are underestimating the\nproblem of recognition.  I think we need to develop several methods\nfor recognizing each case.  Be able to recognize from any angle, etc.\n\nI really think just saying \"oh and look at the case to reconize\" will\nnot work.  We need to turn ZBF2L and ZBLL recognition into a science.\n I am going to post pictures of all my algs from all 4 angles for all\nmy ZBLL algs.  I will make a page for recognition at every angle since\nI believe just recognizing at one will not work to master this method.\n\nThe more I think about it, the harder this method will be to master,\nand the more I want to learn it :-)\n\nSo anyway, I think we have grossly and terribly underestimated the\nproblem of recognition.  I think at a bare minimum we all need to\nrecognize ZBF2L and ZBLL from any angle, and ZBF2L done in any F2L slot.\n\nSo I'm trying to find a balance, but there is so much to do and so\nlittle free time in a day :-(\n\n\nAny help whatsoever would be appreciated, I just want to stay motivated.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A smoother\nand slower zb solve can get a \"super fast moving\"\nfridrich time, in other words.\nAs far as recoginition goes, I do believe it goes\nbeyond just \"oh look at this and execute.\"  It does\nneed to be refined (to be a \"science,\" if you will),\nfor it's much more advanced.  I think reaching new\nlevels, one can be comfortable with the recognition. \nThousands of solves will be required to picture the\nlast laer cases as a whole (like I do with fridrich\nlast layer), but yes I do believe it is possible.  I'm\nnot just saying this; I decided to do a few 24 hour\nmarathons using ONLY ZB (on my own in my room, of\ncourse- not for records) once I know full ZB, and the\npurpose of this will be to conquer the recognition\nhurdles with the known cases.  Sure, the cases would\nbe learned, but recognizing them is a different\nstory...\n\nWhen it comes to me, I learn all the necessary cases\nfor the system to be full, then I practice like crazy;\nthat's how I'm approaching zb, atleast.  That's me.\nThough I don't think I will know zb by 2007, I do\nbelieve I will know it in the course of a couple\nyears.  This is only my opinion, and I could be wrong,\nbut that's how I see it.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter reading Brent's last post I decided to really start refining my\nrecognition.  What I have been doing is to do transformation solves,\nbut only allow myself to see two sides to recognize the ZBLL.  I do\nnot allow AUF (adjust U face) turns either.  It sometimes takes me as\nmuch as 2-3 minutes to recognize one case, but I am learning new\nthings.  I think the goal should be to, like Fridrich, recognize by\nlooking at only 2 faces (I think mastery will recquire no less).  I am\nnot going to time myself for ZB for quite some time (except the sunday\ncontest of course, since I don't want to completely atrophy my\nrecognition) and just work on these identify using two sides only\nrecognition for the T case.  I also do not want to learn any new algs\nfor a while.  I will probably finish my current COLL case, but I want\nto recognize the T case perfectly before moving on.  Also, I can let\nthis be a microcosm of what the other cases will be like.  After I can\nrecognize the T case using only two sides I want to work on averages\nwith transformations, since I think that would show how fast ZB can be\n(just ignore the average it takes me to do the transformation alg for\ncomparison).\n\nAnyway, I think this will extend my time to learn ZB to beyond three\nyears, but I would rather be working on mastering ZBLL than just\nlearning algs and have horrible delays in the future.\n\nI don't know if this is the best strategy, but I am also using the T\ncases to see if I think this will work for the other orientation cases.\n\nLet me know what you all think, does this seem like a good idea?  I'd\nrather not totally commit until I think it might work.  I supppose I\nwill take 2-3 months to work on nothing but T ZBLL recognition.  That\nwill be about 8 months of working on just 1 OLL case.  So I could\nextrapolate that time to the total amount of algs.\n\nI'm setting two side recognition as my goal though, I want to master\nthis system, and I think 2 side recognition will be required for that.\n\nAnd I can't even do COLL with only two sides yet lol, but I am\nlearning how to since I've started practicing this.\n\nAaaaah so much to do, I hope it is worth it.\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "I haven't actually thought about it too much.\n\nHowever I would like to point out that the S-Orientation cases and \nthe Pi-Orientation cases are so rediculously hard to recognize... T-\nOrientation recognition is a breeze for me now, as are many of the L-\nOrientation (*with CP*).\n\nThe recogniton differs widely for ZBLL. For people that use the \nblock method, the more solved corners there are (say for T,U,L \nOrientaitons, and PLL), the easier it would be to get information \nfrom the blocks quickly.\n\nA couple years ago I started using pattern recognition for CLL and \nCOLL, this has helped a lot, but even without it, recognizing by CP \nthen CO was really fast for me. This was becuase I had been \npracticing it for very long. With enough practice the recognition \nshould become second nature.\n\nAs for balence, I'd say, don't learn too much too fast. Take an \nestimate of the ratio of what you have mastered to what you know. I \ndefine what I mastered to be stuff that I have actively and fully \nincorporated into my solving without delays.\n\nI keep this value over 96% always. I know that for instance Hardwick \nis far from no-delays on what he knows of the T5 and T6 cases. I \nthink this is bad... at a certain point one should stop learning new \nthings and stablize in solving and especially in times.\n\nLately I have found lots of 31s-44s times. I get a lot of sub-18 \ntimes as well. What ZB does, *especially if you don't fully master \nCOLL first* is increase one's SD significantly.\n\nThe rule of thumb I use (got it from Jon) is that your SD should be \nat about 2s. If it is over that then you need to figure out what \nyour doing wrong to get rid of those high outliers. If your SD is \nunder 1.7 then you are not taking enough risks. By risks I mean that \nfor instance I will do part of recognition and b4 being totally sure \nof the case, I'll begin an algorithm. By knowing the probabilities \nwell enough instinctively, my average will be lowered this way.\n\nAs for motivation, that always comes right after I get back from a \ncompetition. Every competition I do BLD solves on the plane trip \nhome, something I typically dred doing. I am very motivated to get \nfaster and learn new things. For me it is finding the balence \nbetween learning new techniques and getting faster times.\n\nI learn new things and get to do more exotic things when I solve \nslowly, even taking back moves occasioanlly. I get faster by \npracticing at full speed. rarely do I go full speed though, I would \nhate to have an injury that prevents me from going about my daily \nschool life or typing.\n\nChris: I think that if you feel overwhelmed by the influx of new \nalgs, to stop learning for a while. Work on hte new Fridrich \ntechniques you takled about. A change of pace is good.\n\nAs for me I have a lot of problems in my solving. I pre-inspect for \nalot of things. First I see if it's a very easy cross. If so I check \nfor extended cross. If not I check the locations fo the 4 middle \nedges for my F2L method and then pre-inspect further. In some cases \nI would go about a Petrus solve or a Gilles method solve. I use a \nlot of methodology in my solving. My times would probaly be much \nfaster if I quit doing that, but it would be less fun. I like \ngetting to see all sorts of new things during a sitting, like Brent \ndoes.\n\nA big problem is that for the same CLL/COLL case, I might do the CLL \nwith LL on D and COLL with LL on U. Also, most of my ELL's are still \nwith LL on F or LL on D. I re-grip the hell out of it during my \nsolves. This is a big problem I need to sort out if I want to be \ncompetitive again.\n\nIf I go with a Fridrich cross start, then (like Jessica) I hold my \ncross on L. Learning ZBF2L with LL on U has added extra difficulty \nto my solving.\n\nI decided not to learn anything new for a few months. My S1 cases \nare coming along nicely, but Pi1 is a total disaster.\n\nI use that popular 6-turn oLL a lot, but I do it with on D... this \nis hampering my Pi1 and S1 cases (most of them can be done with \ncompositions of this alg).\n\nHalf my ELL's are with LL on D.... I would need to spend 4 months \nconverting... *sigh*\n\nAt least I can consistantly get under 25s...\n\nWhat would you do if you where me?\n(last time I asked this question someone said: \"gvie up and cry\")\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, \"cmhardw\" <foozman17@h...> wrote:\n>\n> Hey everyone,\n> \n> I recently have been having some doubts about ZB, which I would \nprefer\n> not to be having, but I wanted to bring them up.\n> \n> I recently met with Dan Knights and asked him what he thought about\n> ZB.

        "content": "In reply to all:\n\nI think this is the dilemma:  Fridrich, while averaging more moves and\nhaving less potential for speed with full mastery, is much, much\neasier to implement.  It is a simple and efficient solution.\n\nZB averages far fewer moves, but has the nasty side effect of\nincredibly difficult recognition.  It is much, much harder to fully\nincorporate into solving.\n\nIn the end, I think the best possible scenario would be a hybrid of\nthe two systems.  One that could offer fewer cases (which provides\neasier recognition) and has the potential for fewer moves than\nstandard Fridrich.\n\nLike I've mentioned a few times before, there are four distinct\npossibilities for using the last c/e pair to influence your last layer.\nOrient edges\nPermute edges\nOrient corners\nPermute corners\n\nOrienting corners has the most cases by a long shot.  I think to learn\nhow to orient all the corners is 27 possible cases for whichever way\nyou insert them.  Taking that a step further, learning to orient edges\nand corners with the last pair is 432 cases, including reflections,\njust using case 1 insertions.  This is only 126 cases more than ZBF2L.\n This reduces the entire last layer to a PLL case.  That makes for\n432+21=453 cases for the method, which is just over half of what's\nrequired for ZB, and your PLL cases are all easy to recognize.\n\nAgain, though, whichever step you place more burden on, the harder\nrecognition for that step will be.  The option that I think could be\nmost promising, though I haven't found a reliable way to do it yet,\nwould be orienting edges and permuting corners together.  This would\ngive you a ZB case with no corner permutation for your last step,\nsignificantly easing recognition (not to mention the number of\nrequired algs).  However, it's 112 cases for the c/e pair for\nwhichever case you want to learn.  I would imagine at least 1 and 13,\nmaking for 224+99 possible LL cases=323 cases.  Much better than 797\nfor full ZB.\n\nAgain, just some thoughts, but I'm fairly convinced full ZB will be\ntoo difficult to recognize under pressure consistently, at least\nwithout years and years of practice.\n\n-Mike\nteam [zb]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here are the ones I \nwant to learn most\n\n1) go fast-fast\n- Though people advocate slow-fast, I think for 15.xx and faster \ntimes you have to just go really really fast.  I've only averaged \nsub-16 twice, but both times I tried to literally go as fast as \npossible and just hope I would recognize.  I'm trying to get good at \ngoing faster during F2L, yet still recognize.\n\n2) Master using Xcross and opposite cross\n- If I can get my odds for using Xcross up to 33%, and I am equally \nas comfortable solving either white or yellow, then my odds for an \nXcross are the odds for getting either a white or yellow Xcross.  If \neach face is 33% then I have a 1-(2/3)^2=5/9=55.56% chance of \ngetting an Xcross.  And what's better is the more I learn for \nXcross, the more often I can solve with it on both faces rather than \njust one.\n\n3) flow\n- Macky talks about this a lot, I try to always follow each move \nwith the next one that flows best.  I may choose a longer F2L alg \njust since the shorter one doesn't flow well, etc..\n\n4) learn new algs for my slow cases\n- some of my algs stink, and I just simply need to not be lazy and \nfix them.\n\n5) belive I can do it\n- I took an average today that was 16.04 seconds with a +2 penalty \non one of my counting solves.  Had it not been +2, it would have \nbeen a new pb average record.  All I did different is to just \nthink, \"I'm better than [insert my previous goals, ideas of what a \ngood time is, etc.] and this average will show that.\"\n\nI think a lot of cubing is in our heads.  Just stop telling yourself \nthat your current good times are good enough, but that 1 second \nfaster is a what a good time is.  If you change your view like this, \nyou will try harder to achieve your new good times.  You don't have \nto go overboad, just drop your current good times by 0.5 second or \nno higher than 1.0 second and see what happens.\n\nJust my $0.02 of course,\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The 16.33 was a PLL\nskip using COLL, the 14.72 was a 3 edge cycle after ZBF2L, and the\n18.16 was an OLL skip with ZBF2L.  SD = 2.02  Team [ZB]\n\nThe first 22's both had bad crosses and the last solve I messed up the\nZBF2L.  The first two solves were both the same COLL case, which I\njust changed algs on last night. >:P\n\nI've got very little work this week, so I think I may try to finish\noff as much ZBF2L as I can, and maybe change a few more COLL's to\nfaster ones.  I would like to have all of them well under 3 seconds on\naverage, and most of them less.  I know I looked up during one of my\n21's and saw I finished the F2L in about 14, which means I had a 7\nsecond LL.  Not cool.\n\n-Mike\nteam [zb]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Then for the 4th pair, for example, instead of C3, you\ncould say C3 bad front, to indicate that all edges are flipped\ncorrectly except the front one.  This would give a ZBF2L with almost\nno added cost (since the solves are longer, the small fraction of\nadded recognition becomes less significant).  Then you can call COLL\nfor the next step.  What I'm ultimately curious about, is if it would\nbe possible to assign a simple system that you could use to\ndistinguish among any case and easily decide what algorithm to use for\nfull ZB.

Recognition is not always bad!!!)\n\nI find it weird that the Fridrich averages feel about like my average,\nor at least thereabouts.  Neither one felt extraordinarily fast to me.\n Yet I have definitely been neglecting Fridrich lately for ZB, even\nafter WC2005.  Why does it seem that ZB helps for Fridrich, but not so\nmuch the other way around?  My ZB times are actually slower than a few\nmonths ago.  I think that could either be a) I know more ZBLL cases\nand need to learn to identify them better or b) I have neglected ZB\nbefore WC.\n\nAnyway I find it very odd that not practicing Fridrich.... makes me\nfaster with Fridrich (??).  However, practicing with Fridrich is\npainfully slow improvement for me by comparison.\n\nMy only theory is that the larger number of algs for ZB will work like\na \"weighted bat\" when switching back to Fridrich.\n\nAnyway, this makes me think that even if ZBLL recognition is too much,\nthat using ZB for practice and Fridrich for competitions will make\nyour Fridrich better.\n\nAlso, why not use ZB for the first rounds of a competition and hope\nfor a 1/1944 LL skip?  Or maybe a 1/6 super awesome easy ZBLL case.\n\nI think maybe ZB and Fridrich should coexist and one not replace the\nother.  I've been doing a lot of thinking about the future of ZB, and\nI think that were I in a final round of a big competition, that I\nwould want a simpler method that is still fast since nerves are\nINTENSE.  The final round for the WC was very stressful, and I imagine\nthat trying to use ZB there (except for super easy cases) might only\ncause problems.\n\nBut then again maybe a master of the ZB method would identify ZBLL\nalgs from all angles, AUF only once, etc..\n\nAnyway just some thoughts, what does everyone think?\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been doing lots of practicing switching between ZB and Fridrich\ntoday.\n\nMy Fridrich averages have definitely gotten much faster as of late,\nand my ZB averages definitely much slower.  I think I've found the\nreason too.  Because of WC2005 I've been thinking in Fridrich mode,\nwhich for F2L for me means go as fast as absolutely possible while\nstill being able to catch glimpses of pieces I'll need later.  I've\nfound that instead of slow-fast going \"not quite break neck fast\" for\nF2L gives me better averages.\n\nWell I noticed that this is influencing my ZBF2L.  My ZB solves are\nalways really really bad immediately after switching from a really\ngood Fridrich average, and then get better.  I also tried going what\nfelt like \"too slow\" after doing a good Fridrich average and then my\nZB times got back down to my usual good range for ZB.\n\nSo anyway I think that ZBF2L, even when mastered, should definitely be\ndone slower than Fridrich F2L.  I think ZBF2L should be strictly\ndefined as \"the 4 corners and 4 edges of the first layer, the 4 edges\nof the middle layer, and the opposite layer stickers of the last layer\nedges.\"  I've noticed that by going slower and keeping an idea of how\nthe LL edge orientations will end up, or even inserting pairs earlier\nin the F2L so as to keep my LL edges oriented, helps my times a lot.\n\nThis has me thinking though, obviously since ZBF2L requires more moves\nthan Fridrich F2L, and by all my experience should be done slower,\nthat means that ZBLL has to make up the lost time from ZBF2L.\n\nAlso recognition is clearly going to be an issue, so that time is\nadded as well.  That means that execution of the ZBLL cases has to\novercome that lost time, and should be FAST.\n\nWhat I've been thinking lately, and again I am not trying to keep a\nnegative attitude about ZB, I think the method is brilliant, but I\nlately I've had some persistent doubts about using it in a high\npressure situation.  I am starting to fall back on my idea of using ZB\nas a first and second round method.  Meaning in the first and second\nrounds of a competition you use ZB, which is fast enough to get you to\nthe next rounds.  However, it also has the added benefit of, much more\nlikely than Firdrich, getting a super incredibly easy LL and a super\nfast solve.  So you can use ZB to still make it into the next rounds,\nand have the potential to set some incredibly fast solves.  Then in\nthe final switch back to Fridrich.  Fridrich will seem easier at this\npoint, and you will be under more stress as well.  You will feel as if\nthe easier method balances the more stress and hopefully get a burst\nof confidence to help with nerves.\n\nMaybe this is the best way to approach ZB before mastering it. \nObviously if someone with the mind of Kasparov were an addicted\nspeedcuber he/she would probably be able to speedcube ZB very easily.\n I imagine with practice most people could do that too.  So maybe\nbefore mastering ZB we should approach it as a slightly slower than\nthe main stream methods, that has a greater potential for spike\nsuperfast times and use it accordingly.\n\nThen once people start to master it we can rethink its future.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hello guys/gals,\n       that's interesting.  I have been thinking of f2l a bit lately, pertaining to Fridrich f2l and ZBf2l.  When I take Fridrich f2l averages just to see how my f2l is, I average around 8-9 seconds- but sometimes I'm \"time aware,\" meaning, aware of the time and going as fast as I can, as I watch piece by piece, which might even be faster than just solving cubes.  So this can follow your idea here, Chris.  Fridrich f2l, fast times for it (atleast for me) include going as fast as possible, and seeing each piece and looking ahead (and, also, when your hands are \"in the mood,\" which is a completely new idea that sprung to me the other day- i'll discuss further in the email).\n       Ah, but when I try Zbf2l, I really don't understand _what's_ going on...  I go fast, and the algs don't match up with my style (zbf2l algs require, me atleast, to rotate often, turn D and B more often than usual, and is just way wierd).  Yeah, for me right now, ZBF2L is way slow, and chaotic...  I'll take this \"super slow, maybe too slow\" idea when I practice more, see if it helps me.\n       Another thing, that I found the other day.  I think it was last Wednesday, I had a good day and was refreshed; I did all my school work and was comfortable with myself- I did an average, and I did a 14.52 NOT ROLLING average.  My hands were \"warm\" I guess, and things seemed \"cheery\" or something- I really can't explain it.  My average of 60 was still sub 15- then I had to go do something so I abandoned it.  Then the next day, I did a 17.8 average or something- and my hands just \"couldn't move,\" so to speak.  This spreads to the observation at the WC2005- I was racing a lot of people, since I like it :).  Like when I was racing Chris/Dan Knights/Joel/Andy C/Ryan Patricio/Stefann/others, I pulled a few 12's and 13's that I wouldn't have usually done- then, my hands were \"in the mode\" and keeping constant motion during the F2L- which was making hte biggest difference.  When I was racing Lars V, too, I was experiencing this- I was surprised by how fast my hands were moving!  They\n were just \"in the mood\" and warm, I guess.  I dunno, just something to ponder or observe- the mood of your body and mind when you make an average may make the difference.\n       Anyway, I see the possible doubts for ZB in full.  zbF2l is the biggest nightmare, I agree- I'm making like 16+ zb f2l times, which is crazy. But anyway, sorry for hte long email- there is information out there to help us with the F2L times, that goes beyond the algs.\n   \n  Human capabilities are much underestimated in the matter, i think.  ZB full, when the time comes, will lead to Master times.\n  but this is only my opinion, and not the \"actual\" answer.\n  -Brent M\n\ncmhardw <foozman17@...> wrote:\n  Hey everyone,\n\nI've been doing lots of practicing switching between ZB and Fridrich\ntoday.\n\nMy Fridrich averages have definitely gotten much faster as of late,\nand my ZB averages definitely much slower.  I think I've found the\nreason too.  Because of WC2005 I've been thinking in Fridrich mode,\nwhich for F2L for me means go as fast as absolutely possible while\nstill being able to catch glimpses of pieces I'll need later.  I've\nfound that instead of slow-fast going \"not quite break neck fast\" for\nF2L gives me better averages.\n\nWell I noticed that this is influencing my ZBF2L.  My ZB solves are\nalways really really bad immediately after switching from a really\ngood Fridrich average, and then get better.  I also tried going what\nfelt like \"too slow\" after doing a good Fridrich average and then my\nZB times got back down to my usual good range for ZB.\n\nSo anyway I think that ZBF2L, even when mastered, should definitely be\ndone slower than Fridrich F2L.  I think ZBF2L should be strictly\ndefined as \"the 4 corners and 4 edges of the first layer, the 4 edges\nof the middle layer, and the opposite layer stickers of the last layer\nedges.\"  I've noticed that by going slower and keeping an idea of how\nthe LL edge orientations will end up, or even inserting pairs earlier\nin the F2L so as to keep my LL edges oriented, helps my times a lot.\n\nThis has me thinking though, obviously since ZBF2L requires more moves\nthan Fridrich F2L, and by all my experience should be done slower,\nthat means that ZBLL has to make up the lost time from ZBF2L.\n\nAlso recognition is clearly going to be an issue, so that time is\nadded as well.  That means that execution of the ZBLL cases has to\novercome that lost time, and should be FAST.\n\nWhat I've been thinking lately, and again I am not trying to keep a\nnegative attitude about ZB, I think the method is brilliant, but I\nlately I've had some persistent doubts about using it in a high\npressure situation.  I am starting to fall back on my idea of using ZB\nas a first and second round method.  Meaning in the first and second\nrounds of a competition you use ZB, which is fast enough to get you to\nthe next rounds.  However, it also has the added benefit of, much more\nlikely than Firdrich, getting a super incredibly easy LL and a super\nfast solve.  So you can use ZB to still make it into the next rounds,\nand have the potential to set some incredibly fast solves.  Then in\nthe final switch back to Fridrich.  Fridrich will seem easier at this\npoint, and you will be under more stress as well.  You will feel as if\nthe easier method balances the more stress and hopefully get a burst\nof confidence to help with nerves.\n\nMaybe this is the best way to approach ZB before mastering it. \nObviously if someone with the mind of Kasparov were an addicted\nspeedcuber he/she would probably be able to speedcube ZB very easily.\nI imagine with practice most people could do that too.  So maybe\nbefore mastering ZB we should approach it as a slightly slower than\nthe main stream methods, that has a greater potential for spike\nsuperfast times and use it accordingly.\n\nThen once people start to master it we can rethink its future.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n  SPONSORED LINKS \n        Computer puzzle game   Online puzzle games   Free puzzle games     Puzzle games   Jigsaw puzzle game   Free puzzle inlay games \n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!

I have been thinking of f2l a bit\nlately, pertaining to Fridrich f2l and ZBf2l.  When I take Fridrich\nf2l averages just to see how my f2l is, I average around 8-9 seconds-\nbut sometimes I'm \"time aware,\" meaning, aware of the time and going\nas fast as I can, as I watch piece by piece, which might even be\nfaster than just solving cubes.  So this can follow your idea here,\nChris.  Fridrich f2l, fast times for it (atleast for me) include going\nas fast as possible, and seeing each piece and looking ahead (and,\nalso, when your hands are \"in the mood,\" which is a completely new\nidea that sprung to me the other day- i'll discuss further in the email).\n>        Ah, but when I try Zbf2l, I really don't understand _what's_\ngoing on...  I go fast, and the algs don't match up with my style\n(zbf2l algs require, me atleast, to rotate often, turn D and B more\noften than usual, and is just way wierd).  Yeah, for me right now,\nZBF2L is way slow, and chaotic...

I\nlike the fact that you show mirrors.  I'm also not a big fan of B turns.\n\nI think I may try learning more ZBF2L cases now before I move onto\nmore ZBLL algs.  I've still got a few COLL's I'm getting used to, and\nI've realized my normal PLL's really aren't very fast when I get OLL\nskips.  So, for the added benefit of OLL skips, the corner control\nseems not to be worth it yet.  It may be something to play around with\nmore once I do, but for now, I think it actually hurts my chances for\na good LL step skip, and hurts my chances for a good time even so.\n\nThat said, I think I've got a plan worked out for the order I'd like\nto learn the ZBLL cases.\n\nFirst, the no corner permutation cases.  These are often very nice\ncombinations of Sune type moves, and can be both fast to recognize and\nexecute. After these alone, your chances of a 1 look LL are around 26.44%.\n\nNext, all of the algs for the opposite corners switched.  The\nrecognition on these should be slightly less complicated than the\nother cases, and these bring your chance for a 1 look LL up to almost\n41.15%.\n\nAfter that, I suppose the U perm would be first for me, because most\nof the COLL's I have for that are somewhat slow.  Then the T and L\ncases.  I'm not sure I'd learn anything after that, because that's\nalready a ton to learn, and because the chance for a 1 look is\nsomething like 71% or more.  That ought to keep me busy for an awful\nlong time, especially considering I'm still working on solidifying\nthose last 4 PLL's...\n\n-Mike\nteam [zb]\n\nP.S.

I have been considering switching the way I recognize COLL for\nthe Sune/AntiSune cases.  Currently, I put the oriented sticker at the\nback such that the LL  color on the front face is on the opposite side\nof the oriented corner.  I determine the case by looking at the other\nfront sticker, the top sticker of the other front corner, and the top\nsticker of the third non-oriented corner.  It is, however, possible to\nrecognize using only the top face (as long as you know which\norientation case you have) how the corners are oriented.  However,\nthis requires a bit more advanced thinking.  Currently, I just think\nin terms of whether colors are opposite of each other, the same as\neach other, or neither.  Using the new system of recognition, I would\nhave to determine whether a sticker is opposite another color, left of\nanother color, or right of another color.  I suppose it is not all too\ndifficult to decide this and it would help me learn my color scheme a\nlittle better, so I am quite inclined to try this new recognition\nsystem.  This means, though, that I have to relearn all of my\nSune/AntiSune recognition.\n\nDoes anybody else recognize Sune cases by only looking at the top\nface?  Any thoughts about this system?  And please, if you recognize\nonly by seeing which corners need to swap, then I tell you in advance\nthat I have tried that system and used it for 3 years didn't like it.  :P\n\n~ Bob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hey Mike,\n\nI've also been thinking about ways to modify ZB somehow.\n\nI guess lately, I have had some doubts about full ZB but I've had some\nencouragement as well.\n\nThe all edges correct ZBLL cases are useful for a new BLD system I\nwant to implement.  Basically it is like the best of Stefan Pochman's\nsolve orientation and permutation startegy, combined with the\nquickness of cycle solving.  Basically you use algs to both permute\nand orient 2 corners at a time, like in cycles solving.  Also you can\nuse ELL to do the same for the edges.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that sometimes in my Fridrich solving I use ZB\nstuff even when I tell myself \"Fridrich only this average.\"\n\nI had one particular solve lately where I had a case 4 ZBF2L (the\ncorner is flipped, otherwise the pair is already solved) and all LL\nedges flipped.  Normally I use the all edges correct alg for my\nstandard Fridrich alg, but during this solve without even thinking I\ndid the ZBF2L, the COLL and PLL finsih and got a 16.xx solve.\n\nAlso, for me at least ZB helps tremendously for making Fridrich seem\nlike an \"easier\" method.  The weighted bat effect I call it.\n\nSo here is what I am thinking, I still want to learn full ZB since\nthere are so many subsets of ZBLL that are so incredibly useful. \nAlso, though I am doubting the speed of ZB (how do we overcome the\ntime lost in ZBF2L and also ZBLL recognition and also in some cases\nthe slow execution of the ZBLL alg?) I can only think of good effects\nfrom learning it.\n\nIt's a weird thought, and I wonder if I am the only one who thinks\nthis way.  The more I learn for ZBLL the more I find that there are in\nfact really, incredibly crappy cases that are very slow to solve. \nHowever, with enough practice I can still make my ZBLL alg faster than\nOLL/PLL or COLL/PLL finish on average (not every execution).\n\nSo anyway, I am still very dedicated to learning all of ZB, since it\ndoes so many good things for cubing in general, but I seriously doubt\nI will use ZB in a future competition other than as a \"first round\nmethod\"  Sort of as saying I know I can use ZB fast enough to make the\nfirst cut, so I might as well go for a lucky LL case and hopefully\nsome sort of single solve record, and for the other rounds use Fridrich.\n\nI wonder also if maybe learning all of ZB, then using it for 5 years\nwill make the delay problems just go away.  Maybe learning ZB and\nusing it in practice until the day comes when you can recognize very\nquickly will be a good strategy for how to learn it, yet maintain the\nability to do well in competitions also.\n\nAnyway this e-mail is getting long, but I just wanted to post about\nhow I was thinking lately.\n\nChris\n\nP.S.  Also in case anyone is interested, in the last week I have\naveraged sub-16 three times, and have been getting solves 20 and over\nonly about 5% of the time or even less.  This is a _huge_ improvement\nfor me, and the reason is that I now use opposite colors solving\nreligiously.  I seriously see the difference with my new roughly 50%\nchance for getting a good Xcross solve on either face.  Let's get rid\nof this \"always solve the same color\" dogma.  It's outdated, and not\nas fast as opposite color, and opposite color is by far a better\nmethod (just look at the math behind it for proof).  It has already\ndrastically improved my times from what they used to be.  Just food\nfor thought.\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, \"Mike Bennett\" <mikebennett_one@h...>\nwrote:\n>\n> Also, I was looking around Lars Petrus' site the other day and\n> realized something.

We have to set the standard of sub-3 average for\nevery alg (just straight execution) and that would make the LL have a\nsub-4 solve time with recognition also (in theory).\n\nWell I don't think even a few people could do this in a short amount\nof time, so here is the suggestion.  ZB doesn't have much popularity\nyet, since it isn't fast.  Sadly it will take that to get many to\nnotice.  Also, why learn ZBLL quickly now and redo 300 algs later when\nit does gain some popularity after people have learned it, when we can\nall work on generating algs (with the sub-3 requirement) and make it\nfast now?\n\nIt would work like this, learn ZBLL in any way you want, and generate\nand save all algs for that path.  If you are learning algs that have\nalready been generated, then learn the algs you want from a webpage or\nfrom someone, but generate other cases only to make them fast, learn\nthem later.\n\nWe could each take a COLL case and generate algs and spend a few weeks\nor maybe a month on optimizing each case to sub-3.\n\nAfter that we can meet here and post the best ones on a central\nwebsite (perhaps Ron will lend us a space in the Algs section).\n\nI think if we make ZBLL fast right from the start, then we can learn\nthe fastest ZBLL right from the start and have a chance for the method\nto be fast.\n\nI know a lot of you guys are very serious about the method, so I ask:\nwho is willing to help me make a sub-3 requirement for ZBLL a reality?\n I can start with my slowest T algs (some are already easily sub-3)\nand work from there.  Again you don't have to learn the algs you\ngenerate, learn however you want, but spend time each day helping\noptimize the ZBLL.\n\nI think with all of us it will still not be much man power, but it\nwill be enough to make a start.\n\nI will now require sub-3 for all algs, and try to spend a few weeks to\n1 month on each COLL case to really get this right.  I will stop\nlearning until my T and U algs are fully sub-3 optimized.\n\nAlso if sub-3 is just not possible, let's find the true limit, and get\nunder that.\n\nZB can still have a change, but we have to have a higher standard than\nsub-4.  I'm already convinced that a sub-4 ZBLL stands no change\nwhatsoever against Fridrich.\n\nI'm going to start on my worst T cases and go from there.  Is anyone\nelse interested?  Let me know, I would really love for all of us to\nreally take this method seriously (we already do, but I think a new\nlevel of dedication will be required for ZB to be fast) and move this\nmethod into being a top level method?\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This is helping my\nZB in three ways:\n\nFirst, when I solve for extended periods of time and then switch to\nCOLL/ZB, it forces me to go slower on my F2L, because I'm not as used\nto it.  I'm more fluid, and I always get nice times, often sub-17. \nUsually I have to do at least 10 or more Roux solves before I can\nguarantee times like that, though.  I can even do great times with\nterrible crosses much more frequently this way.\n\nRoux solving uses a lot of flexible ways to start the 1x2x3 blocks,\nand is aiding in my practice for x-cross.  I'm not very good at it\nyet, but I'm getting much better with all of this block practice.\n\nLast, I'm starting to learn Doug's algs for orienting edges while\ninserting the last cross piece.  It's really only 22 distinct cases (3\nof those being ones where the piece is already inserted and you must\nflip edges manually. These shouldn't come up except in unusual\ncircumstances.)   Because starting with only 3 cross pieces makes\nx-cross far, far easier, and gives you only 19 real cases for flipping\nedges, this may be something for ZB beginners to look into as an entry\npoint, or even a semi-permanent stepping stone to full ZBF2L.  It\ncould be an alternative to VHF2L, really.  The downside to always\nstarting with this is that it averages about 6.5 moves per alg, so\nit's a few extra moves, but this is balanced by the fact that they're\nalmost all completable using only M and U turns.\n\nI think I'm going to keep working on improvements for the Roux method\nfor a bit, though, because it's a great method that deserves as much\nattention and effort as ZB is getting (and Fridrich has gotten).  If I\ncan average about 50 moves with it (STM), without learning any real\nspecial cases, still using COLL instead of CLL, and using the slower\nand more moves edge orienting step, I think the potential here is very\ngreat.  Add in the improvements I mentioned in a post on the big\ngroup, and I think this method could rival ZB for speed, at least in\nsingle solves.  Especially at a small fraction of the number of algs,\nthe flexibility of the beginning of the solves, much easier\nrecognition, and the very quick M and U turn finish.\n\nStill, I like to think of any sort of improvement to an existing\nsystem along these lines as an extension of ZB. At least until I come\nup with a snappy name. ;)\n\n-Mike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hey Gilles,\n\nThat would be awesome thank you!  I'm also going to start searching\nand including all the search lists for the algs for others to search\nfor ones they like too.\n\nHere is the biggest problem.  We all have different styles.  I vastly\nprefer RULM to anything else, and will often choose a sub-optimal RULM\nalg over an optimal length one.\n\nAlso, some people are better at using the optimal algs and getting\nthem to full speed.\n\nSo here is the idea.  I am a self proclaimed RULM user.  I prefer RULM\nto anything else, although I do have lots of RUF and RULFD types algs\nthat I like a lot.\n\nSo once someone finds a list of potential algs for a case I could\nsearch for the RULM alg, and someone who is better at making the\noptimal alg fast could search for that.\n\nWe can group ourselves accorind go out styles.  That way, on the\ncentral site where we post these algs, each case will have upwards of\nhopefully 10 different algs that are optimized for different styles. \nIf 10 isn't possible, at least a few to choose from.\n\nI don't know the best way to set up this group interaction, perhaps we\ncan all vote for our favorite and vastly preferred styles to start\nwith.  I am very much a RULM solver though, and prefer it to all other\ntypes by far.\n\nIf too many of us are the same style then we can branch out.  I also\nlike RUF a lot and could search for those.\n\nBasically we need people to just search for algs in all types of\nmetrics, and people to sift through algs once they are found.  Imay\neven be able to get Richard Patterson to help us for the sifting part.\n I am willing to run my processor 24-7 to search for algs, as well as\nlook for good ones among those found.\n\nWe should coordinate as a team and work on these together.  Let's\nserioulsly turn team [zb] into a group effort to improve the ZB\nmethod.  I do think with a truly optimized ZBLL, that this method can\nbe one of the best, if not the best.  But it will take a flawless ZBLL.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.  I want to start with my\nT-orientations case 1 algs first.  Most are sub-3 already, but I want\nto optimize those that aren't and also research and provide algs for\ndifferent styles as well.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  Should we make a database and divy up all the\nCOLL cases?  What would work best, I want as much input from everyone\nas we can get so that everyone can enjoy what they are working on, and\ndo what they want to work on.\n\nChris\ndefinitely still team [zb] as well\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles van den Peereboom\n<gillesvdp@g...> wrote:\n>\n> Hello,\n> \n> Even though I stopped learning ZB a few weeks ago, I'm still\n> interested in that extension.\n> I'm kind of fed up with learning an huge amount of algorithms without\n> always understanding what I do.\n> But I'm really interested in finding new ones either by myself or with\n> the help of a computer.\n> \n> If you want some help, I could help for exemple on one of the\n> orientation case (maybe split it with someone if anybody is\n> interested).\n> \n> I'm rather fond of the Double-Sune orientation so if there is any case\n> you prefer to have first (since I'm probably not gonna use this in\n> competition), just tell me which one :-)\n> \n> Gilles.\n> \n> 2005/12/11, cmhardw <foozman17@h...>:\n> >  Hey everyone,\n> >\n> >  I've been talking to Richard a lot lately, and he really inspired me\n> >  about one thing.\n> >\n> >  I think ZBLL can be extremely fast, but we have to set a higher\n> >  standard for it.

I couldn't trigger L'U2 for instance.\n\nI'm not sure how to describe my style, but one thing is clear: I use \nmy right thumb more than anybody other cubers I've watched.\n\nI'm going to post my algs up sometime over break, if you don't mind \nChris, I'm going to use your pages as a template to get these up \nquicker (and I love the php cube image thing).\n\nI recommend working on the U3 and U4 cases since they are next on \nthe list, so to speak.

There are plenty of people working on T and even\nU algs, Doug and others have the no corner perm algs covered pretty\nwell, and I know at least Dan Harris has a start on the L algs.  After\nthat, no one seems to have a distinct order in mind.

Wise idea.\n  -brent M_\n\ncmhardw <foozman17@...> wrote:\n  Hey everyone,\n\nI've been talking to Richard a lot lately, and he really inspired me\nabout one thing.\n\nI think ZBLL can be extremely fast, but we have to set a higher\nstandard for it.  We have to set the standard of sub-3 average for\nevery alg (just straight execution) and that would make the LL have a\nsub-4 solve time with recognition also (in theory).\n\nWell I don't think even a few people could do this in a short amount\nof time, so here is the suggestion.  ZB doesn't have much popularity\nyet, since it isn't fast.  Sadly it will take that to get many to\nnotice.  Also, why learn ZBLL quickly now and redo 300 algs later when\nit does gain some popularity after people have learned it, when we can\nall work on generating algs (with the sub-3 requirement) and make it\nfast now?\n\nIt would work like this, learn ZBLL in any way you want, and generate\nand save all algs for that path.  If you are learning algs that have\nalready been generated, then learn the algs you want from a webpage or\nfrom someone, but generate other cases only to make them fast, learn\nthem later.\n\nWe could each take a COLL case and generate algs and spend a few weeks\nor maybe a month on optimizing each case to sub-3.\n\nAfter that we can meet here and post the best ones on a central\nwebsite (perhaps Ron will lend us a space in the Algs section).\n\nI think if we make ZBLL fast right from the start, then we can learn\nthe fastest ZBLL right from the start and have a chance for the method\nto be fast.\n\nI know a lot of you guys are very serious about the method, so I ask:\nwho is willing to help me make a sub-3 requirement for ZBLL a reality?\nI can start with my slowest T algs (some are already easily sub-3)\nand work from there.  Again you don't have to learn the algs you\ngenerate, learn however you want, but spend time each day helping\noptimize the ZBLL.\n\nI think with all of us it will still not be much man power, but it\nwill be enough to make a start.\n\nI will now require sub-3 for all algs, and try to spend a few weeks to\n1 month on each COLL case to really get this right.  I will stop\nlearning until my T and U algs are fully sub-3 optimized.\n\nAlso if sub-3 is just not possible, let's find the true limit, and get\nunder that.\n\nZB can still have a change, but we have to have a higher standard than\nsub-4.  I'm already convinced that a sub-4 ZBLL stands no change\nwhatsoever against Fridrich.\n\nI'm going to start on my worst T cases and go from there.  Is anyone\nelse interested?  Let me know, I would really love for all of us to\nreally take this method seriously (we already do, but I think a new\nlevel of dedication will be required for ZB to be fast) and move this\nmethod into being a top level method?\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  YAHOO!

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nRichard Patterson and I have been talking, and here is a proposed\ndelgation of responsibility.  We're really turning into a research\nteam like Gilles said, so I think it would be best if we delegated the\nresponsibility.\n\nHere is the proposed delegation.  Let's see how this would work based\non our resources, and also with what each person wants to do.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA->  The lead will be in charge of delegating groups B, C, & D.\n\nB->  Those in charge of Web Space Management have two main\nresponsibilities.  First,\nto receive raw sequences from group C, and to post them online in a\nway that it is\nreadily available for group D.  Second, to post optimized sequences\nreceived from\ngroup D.\n\nC->  This group's main responsibility is to generate raw sequences for\ntarget cases,\nas delegated by the lead.  Upon generating those raw cases, this group\nwill be\nresponsible for sending their output to group B.\n\nD->  This group is responsible for optimizing raw sequences posted\nonline by group B.  Upon optimizing, this group will send their\nresults to group B to be posted.\n\n**  To insure focus and synergy among the groups, the lead must\ncollaborate with all\nthe groups.  The target cases should be known and sought by each\ngroup.  This will\nhelp for organizational purposes.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso since we are a small group, we may need to overlap a little bit\nas well.  I am willing to do any of the above responsibilities.  My\ncomputer processor is open for searching, and I also really enjoy\noptimizing sequences.\n\nAlso we can use my space on speedcubing.com to post sequences that are\nboth raw sequences and optimized.  I will e-mail Ron as well and see\nif we can use the space on the algorithms page for our final sequences.\n\nThis is really exciting!  I think with this group effort to optimize\nZBLL that we will be able to bring it into prominence as a method and\nget others interested.  Also, I belive that a group effort could make\nZB a very efficient method, possibly even more efficient that Fridrich.\n\nIt sounds like we are all dedicated and ready to start working on the\nmethod.  All we need now is to organize ourselves and we can really\nefficiently start optimizing algs.\n\nLet me know what you think.  It already sounds like we have people\nwanting to do certain things, so let's try to organize.\n\nFirst thing, everyone say what you think of the proposed delegation. \nFirst off, does it fit our resources?  Also, do we have enough people\nto make this work?  I've made a database, basically just a roll call,\nof who is interested in working in taking part of the optimization.\n\nWell, we won't be the inventors of ZB, but we'll sure be remembered as\nthe ones who really turned it into a nice speedcubing method :-)\n\nLet's really turn this team [zb] idea into a serious team that's well\nknown in the speedcubing community.\n\nAlso, with the new variations that are coming up, I think we should\nhandle those accordingly on the central website.  Any alternative to\nZBLL that includes ZBLL will need optimized algs, so perhaps we should\nstart with those cases first in our optimization.  If we can fill all\nthe algs necessary for a variation of ZB with super nice algs, maybe\nwe can bring the skeptics into the method by allowing them to try a\nsuperfast variation of ZB before committing to the whole method.\n\nThis is all very exciting for me!  I'm glad that we all have the\ninterest in this method!\n\nOk, everyone post in the database if you are interested in being on\nthe research team, and also what resources are available to you.\n\nThanks everyone, and I think we've definitely become a full strength\nteam.  Now we just have to show the speedcubing community that we're\nserious, and that we mean business.\n\nChris\nTeam [ZB]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hey Doug,\n\nWow that would be awesome!  I can start coming up with some search\nstrings that I always use.\n\nAlso, I think we should come up with a set procedure for the searching\nso that every case gets the same amount of search time.\n\nHere is what I think should be done based on my experience with the T\nand U cases, but I'm of course open to suggestions.\n\nFirst search for quartern turn optimized algs and print out all of them.\n\nThe startup string for ACube is then\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa\n\nThen search for all algs (this includes ones in RULM, RUF, etc.. since\nit prints every alg, or at least most of them, more on that later).\n\nThen since we have to accomodate all styles we should do the same\nthing in also HTM and STM.\n\nSo the other two search strings would be\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube a (for HTM, since ACube defaults to HTM) and\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube sa\n\nNow, everyone gets a copy of the QTM optimized list, and then the STM\nusers also take the STM list and the HTM users take the HTM list too.\n\nWhen searching for an alg try to find the best ones on the QTM list\nthat are also on either the HTM or STM list.  This gives you an idea\nof what a fast alg in either HTM or STM is like.  Then compare you QTM\nand HTM dual optimized alg to other algs on the HTM list and see if\none is better.\n\nThat is how I found all my ZBLL algs.  The QTM list is an amazingly\npowerful filter for algs, and I always use it in conjunction with the\nHTM list (STM users would do well to also use it for their STM algs I\nbelieve).\n\nSo the most important is that we have a search string with each of these\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube a\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube sa\n\nAlso, the program is more likely to find suboptimal length cases if\nyou search within your preferred faces.\n\nSuboptimal length algs tend to be the faster ones for me (not always\nof course).\n\nSo you would again search in QTM for algs in the RULM group say, and\nalso in the HTM group.\n\nIt is a tedious process, but the algs you get out of it the best\nquality I've been able to find.\n\nSo this would mean that we may need to do a lot of searches on each case.\n\nFor example take a new H case.\n\nNow search that case in QTM with\njava -cp ACube3.jar ACube qa\n\nafter that search is over, run another one still within QTM for every\npreferred move group.  RUF, RULM, etc..\n\nNow restart ACube in HTM and STM and do the same, do an all search,\nand also search for our preferred face groups.\n\nThis may be very repetitive, and not the most efficient way.  I am not\na computer programmer, so those with computer experience please help\nto optimize this process!\n\nBasically, this is the procedure I used to find my best algs for ZBLL.\n\nI think the most important is that any search must have a QTM\ncounterpart to compare to the HTM and STM search to dual optimize each\nalg for HTM and QTM or also STM and QTM.\n\nAlso, it is very important that we also search specifically for moves\nin our preferred move groups, since Acube doesn't print out every\nsingle alg it finds, but only 95-99% of them.  Also this maximizes\nyour chances of finding the suboptimal length algs that are super fast\n(suney type algs are a good example, ACube optimal searches weed them\nout almost 100% of the time, since they are almost never optimal\nlength)  I could only ever find suney type algs with searches in RUL\nmoves specifically.\n\nAgain these are just my thoughts, you guys have more computer\nexperience than me by far!  Let's come up with a rigid procedure for\ngeneration raw algs!  This will be a very important substep to moving on.\n\nChris\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, \"Doug Lee\" <d_funny007@y...> wrote:\n>\n> First I'd like to say that this is an excellent time to get this \n> going.

        "content": "Yes I agree.\n\nWell in addition to the desired masks, it is probably best to also \ndo a general (no mask) search.\n\nI can run an entire COLL category for you guys, just prepare the \ninput lines, so I don't have to think about it. E-mail them to me at\nd_funny007 [at] yahoo.\n\n1 COLL times 12 edge possibilites (though usually less) times 4 \nmaskings times 3 metrics is 144 (though typically half due to \nsymmetries) ACube runs per COLL... this is rediculous (although I \ncan do one in one night if need be).\n\nWe need to take out STM and one of the masks, you see we don't \nreally lose much, it usualy happens that the nice RUF or URD algs \ncome through in the general search. (RUL algs are genereal too far \naway from optimal to catch in the general serach)\n\nIf we just do RULM and a general search, each in FTM only then it's \nonly 24 outputs to sort through per COLL case (and thare are not too \nmany COLLs). Only if there is some serious problems with finding a \ngood one there should we go farther.\n\nBut this is my opinion only, and I acknowledge that being part of a \ngroup means that I will have to do what ever task is assigned to me.\n\nThus I await school to be over so that someone from self-\nselected \"group A\" gives me concrete instructions. Until then I will \ncontinue posting my \"no CP\" algs, which have been in my notes and \ngone through a few years of evolution.\n\nAlso, if no one wants to do this task, I guess I can spend time \ncoding something that will generate a lot of input lines. But that \nwill take up a lot of my time.\n\nOk perhaps someone here has time, and wants to take up a chunk of \nthe ZBLL and type out the input lines for them. And before you run \nthem, e-mail them to me and if I'm not terribly busy I bet I will \nbeat your computer to it. (don't take my enthusiasm the wrong way)\n\nAlso, just to get started with things (as we wait for further \ndirection from our fearless leader), could some one go through T1 \ntimings for Chris's page, look at his T5 algs, and also my L1 algs \nthat I posted earlier, as well as the ones someone else posted \nearlier at http://www.belgiancubes.be/zbll/ for diagonal CP H-\nOrientaion cases.\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Gilles van den Peereboom \n<gillesvdp@g...> wrote:\n>\n> I think that searching with too many masks will just take forever.\n> We need to balance the qualitity of our work and the progress \n(after all,\n> there are still quite a lot of cases).\n> \n> I'm kind of happy with these masks ( RULM, RUF, URD).\n> I don't know how to use ACube very well, I don't even know how to \nput a\n> mask.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to ask basically what we wanted to do as a group about the\nlead position, or group A.  I honestly am willing to devote the time\nto any of the activities in our delegation, but I would love to help\ndirect.  I will have the free time after I graduate (I really do cube\nin all of my free time, so it won't be a big change).\n\nHowever, there is an issue.  On Dec. 19 I am leaving for California to\nvisit my Grandparents and won't be back until Jan. 6.  During this\ntime I won't have any access to the internet whatsoever.\n\nIn this formative period of team [zb] I don't think it would be good\nfor me to delegate, simply since I will be absent for roughly three\nweeks very shortly.  I will take my laptop with me and analyze cases\nand optimize algs while I am gone though.\n\nMy question is this, what should we do about the lead position?  I\nwould love to really be a part of this group and help each of the\ngroups and try to do all of the group activities we need, but the\ntruth is that I will be absent for three weeks very soon.\n\nSo we need a lead, or preferably more than one in case the other is\nabsent.\n\nI am more than willing to dedicate my time to team [zb] and would love\nto do so, but I simply cannot do that until after Jan. 6 next year.\n\nWho else wants to take over in a lead position and make sure the group\nis directed in a good direction?\n\nThis organization is so awesome, and I am so excited to see us coming\ntogether into a real research team.  I hope everyone has a good\nholiday, and in my free time between finals up until I leave I will\ntry to do as much as I can.  I will only be able to analyze cases and\ngenerate raw algs while on vacation, but after I return I will have\nthe free time and the ability to fully dedicate myself to our effort.\n\nLet me know what everyone thinks,\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Could \nsomeone look at those and perhaps see if the ones (half) Chris posted \non his site are among them... or perhaps better ones.\n\nThis was to benchmark my computer setup.\n\nIt took about 8 hours... I had a second computer also do the same run \nto double-check the results (sort of unnecessary).\n\nI posted the results in the files section of this group. I think each \nof you should create a folder with your name when you post data like \nthis. I don't think we'll run out of room here.... it's all text files.\n\nI also posted the 5EO/5EP algs sets... something Mike said he was \ninterested in. Have a look if you're curious.\n\nI have 3 fairly powerful computers in my apartment (1 seems to beep a \nlot when overheated though)... I can spend about 10 hrs (so 1 day) to \ndo 3 COLL cases.\n\nFor the purposes of generating algs, I think inverses should be \ncounted separately, mirrors together, and PLLs skipped (obviously). \nThis yields 29 cases by my rough count. (5 T, 5 U, 4 L, 6 S, 5 Pi, 4 H)\n\nChris has 6.5 of these done. Now that I went through U2 in it's \nentirety, that leaves only 22 COLLs. I should be able to do this in \nabout 11 days. (Keep one computer free for my gaming needs :).)\n\nThis is a \"quick and dirty double pass,\" I run them all FTM optimized \nwith 777 and 431 masking. 431 is many times faster than 777 it turns \nout.\n\nOnce I take the 16 brand new Dells out of their boxes, set them up and \nrun have them running ACube... I'm thinking 2.5 days, or 2 days based \non what I'll already have completed.\n\nBy getting through all this so fast, I can go back though at a latter \ntime to work on specific ones, for FUR-type or various sub-opt finds.\n\nI've already started churning out the U3/U4 algs on my 2 fastest \ncomputers. I estimate being 25% done with this COLL. Someone start on \nthe L-Orientation (minus no CP) if you want to join in on my effort. I \nhope you guys are satisfied that me and Chris have the U-Orientation \ncovered.\n\nAt the end of this \"first quick pass\", I'll also do on the T-\nOrientations and \"no CP ones\" just for completeness.\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "I just uploaded raw algs for the U3 case.\n\nU4 is just it's mirror so it shouldn't need to be done separately.\n\nI just did all 12 edge cases in the COLL. I ran them in FTM \noptimized, one file is in 777 (for all turns) and another in 431 \n(for RULM restriction).\n\nI noticed that 777 take about 5 times longer to search. Also there \nis always one or two 777, that take forever (like 2 hrs for my \ncomputers to do).\n\nI have some triggered-algs for some of them already... I'll post \nthose sometime... in the same way I posted my L1 set.\n\nAlso, do note that I posted U2 algs. I reduced it down to 7 cases, I \nran them 777 and 431 alternating for 14 runs. This is also availble.\n\nU5 is small, so I'll start them now and they oughta be done in 3-\n4hrs so I'll post those tomorrow when i get the chance. It can be \nreduced to 6 cases, so only 12 runs...\n\nI'm taking care of all the U-Orientatations like Chris wanted from \nme... I hope he likes what I tried to do.\n\n(Side-note: U3_431 only took a couple hrs and was availble at 2pm...)\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I would have been able to post the U5 set like 4 hrs ago, but \nthere is this one rediculous case that is taking it forever to \ngenrerate.\n\nU-Orientation, CP is diagonal, EP is 4E-circular, turnmask 777.\n\nOver 4.5 hrs for just one ZBLL alg has got to be a record.\n\nI have yet to find a way to have multiple computers work on the same \ninput line at the same time to cut the time up. I have a friend that \nspecializes in converting code into something parallel-processing \ncapable. I should see if he can help me.\n\nAnyways, it's 6:30am here, I'm bored with insomnia. Also one of my \ncomputers is busted, not really..., but just many times slower than \nmy new one, so it's not worth using anymore. 3 COLLs in 1.5 days \nisn't too bad right? That leaves 20 categories, times 12 hrs per \ncategory (conservatively factoring in various down-times)... so 10 \ndays. Still I gotta pump up the throughput at some point.\n\nThere's a lot of down-time, like for now, I have 2 computers not \ndoing anything... should just start the U6 cases. That would require \nme to make the input file though, and I can't be bothered with that \nright now.\n\nJust wanted to check in. I want to look at the U2 cases myself \n(Chris is working on them too, and we have been discussing specific \nU2 algs for a couple weeks). One of you can do the U3/U4 if you have \ntime.\n\nI'll post the U5 ASAP. It seems that with 12 cases in U3 to look \nthrough we should be busy for a while anyhow. My goal is to take \ncare of the distributed commputing workload.\n\nNow since that leaves room for a break to skip elsewhere, feel free \nto post input lines for regions of ZB your working on and I'll get \non it over the weekend. (This is for those of you out there with \nslow computers and a lot of cases to run.)\n\nIf nobody asks me to do anything, I'm going to run the the Diagonal \nH-Orientation cases that Gilles is working on. It should give him \nmore raw data to work with.\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I ordered them in that order... the first column going \ndown, unless there is one that is not mirror on the right then I \nincluded in in that slot. (i.e. they are numbered according to the \nway English is read: top to bottom, left to right, but skipping \nredundant ones.)\n\nOne exception:\nU3 and T3 I had a program (Mathematica) populate the input lines for \nsince there where all 12 EP possiblities there. They are ordered in \nalphabetical order of the input line.... so not very helpful but it \nwas my quick and dirty way of cooking the input lines up.\n\nThe first half of the file is done in no turn mask (or equiv. 777). \nThe second half is done in 431.\n\nI recommend that you look at both when digging though a specific \ncase. 777 is general search, 431 is RULM-type search. Both are FTM \noptimized as you can see.\n\nHelp is appriciated. But do post on what cases you are working on so \nthat we don't have two ppl doing the same thing. Post your results \noon WikiCube if possible.\n\n\n-Doug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nSome of you may have already been using Transformation algorithms in \nyour ZB practice, either through inspiration from Chris or maybe you \ncame up with the idea yourself.\n\nIf you don't know what it is, the idea is to apply a simple \nalgorithm to the Orientation case you end up with after ZBF2L or \nVHF2L, to end up with a case that you know. So if you had only \nlearned some T-Orientation ZBLL cases, and when solving you ended up \nwith an L, you could apply an algorithm to transform it into a T-\nOrientation. Of course, this doesn't advance you any further as far \nas the method is concerned, because it's not useful for \nspeedsolving, but it is a very useful practice tool because it \nallows you to rehearse your knowledge with every cube.\n\nMost of the transformation algorithms I have used are very simple, \nand sometimes involve 4 or more Sunes just to get the right case, so \nit's not very efficient. It would be very nice if we could have a \nstandard set of transformation algorithms that use the minimum \namount of sequences.\n\nIt would be elegant if we could have something like\n1 = Sune (R U R' U R U2 R')\n2 = A-Sune (R U2 R' U' R U' R')\n3 = a move which only affects two corners\n4 = inverse of 3?\n\nusing the minimum amount of sequences - 4 would be nice but I think \nwe may have to use 6?\n\nThen we could write the algorithms as a combination of U moves and \nthese move sequences.\n\nExample: U -> L = U [1]\n         T -> L = U' [2] U'\n\nAnybody willing to help work on this set? First thing would be to \nstandardise a set of moves sequences to use.\n\nDan H :)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "Ok.  So I've been experimenting with the Roux method and several\nvariations of Step 4 (last 6 edges), as well as FMC.  Anyway, all this\nplaying around has breathed new life into one of my old ideas.\n\nI was looking for ways to break the burden of the ZBLL up into easier\nchunks earlier in the solve.  My original idea was to use the last\npair to try and fix corner orientation.  Something like 54 cases,\nprobably long and definitely hard to recognize.  I also realized it\nwould be most useful to learn how to earlier achieve correct\npermutation on the LL corners, as well as edges, leaving you with only\na no corners perm ZBLL alg.  However, I couldn't find good ways to do\nthat, and it was something like 100+ cases, also probably difficult to\nrecognize.  Last night, I had a new idea.\n\nWhat if you finished the F2L minus one pair?  As long as the corner is\nin the top layer, you have one of 3 possible cases.  Corner with white\nfacing up, left, or right.  If you place this corner, there are 6\npossible cases for each of the 3 orientations above for fixing the LL\ncorner perm.  Most of these are simple and intuitive (just different\nways to place the corner: RUR', U'F'UF, etc.).  18 cases total, not\nbad.  You could learn the 14 cases for when the corner is in the\ncorrect spot, if you wanted, but you pretty much always avoid those\nwith some careful solving of the first three pairs.  COLL and CLL\nwould come in handy, too.\n\nNext, if you solve the final middle layer edge, you can orient the LL\nedges at the same time.  20 more cases for fixing the LL edge\norientation (edge in place but flipped: 4, edge at UR flipped: 8,\nmirrors of the last 8: 8).  38 cases (most of them are just 3 cycles\nof edges), and you're left with a no corners perm ZBLL.  Add in those\ncases, and you've got 72 more (76 with the edge PLL's).  114 total\nalgs (just about half of which are reflections), but I'm not sure of\nthe length yet.  I'll keep working on that and post again.\n\n1/27 cases would be a simple edge PLL to finish.  If you could learn a\nfew extra cases to place the final middle layer edge while also\nplaying with corner orientation, you could increase that number\nsubstantially.  I know this may be a potentially longer method in\nterms of number of moves, but having an edge PLL for possibly 1/13.5\nsolves or more has some definite potential. 1/162 solves, you get a LL\nskip!\n\nAs an alternative, you could solve 3 cross pieces, 3 pairs, and use\nZBF2L or VHF2L on the final pair, orienting edges, then perform COLL,\nand finish with any of the L5E algs Doug was nice enough to find for\nme.  This gives you more freedom for building the F2L and makes Xcross\nmuch easier.  If you like slice moves in the MU set, this might be a\ngood way to go for you.\n\nAnywho, I'm tired of rambling, so someone else let me know what you think.\n\n-Mike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There are really only 8 cases for when the corner is\nalready in the right spot, and these come up 1/5 of the time, so it's\nprobably a good idea.  One of those is even just FRUR'U'F' or its\ninverse. 18 + 8 = 26.  Still not bad to get all the LL cases down to\nno corner perm.  All in all, this step should average between 5 and 6\nmoves by my calculations, but probably closer to 5.

I'll keep working on that and post again.\n\nI was wrong again.  There are 3 cases for when the edge is in place, 3\nfor when it's in place but flipped,  and then the other 8 and 8.  That\nmakes 22 instead of 20.  The average length for these should be\nbetween 7 and 9, but I'm not certain yet.  The upside to this is that\nthey're all performable with only MU and RU moves.  The hardest cases\nare when 4 edges are flipped, but I'm working on ways to solve those\nquickly. (read: Cubesolver, here I come...)\n\nAnyway, that's about 124 algs total, a good chunk of which we all\nalready know.  The average length is about 12 or 13, so it's\ncomparable to learning ZBLL, but there are a whole lot less of them.\n \n> 1/27 cases would be a simple edge PLL to finish.

Between those\nand the edge PLL cases (not including the long Z perm), you have\ngreater than a 1/12 chance for a 7 move or less solve.  I wouldn't\nmind getting a Sune only solve once an average.\n\nAs for the final move count, that's still a bit up in the air. \nAssuming a 23 move F2L minus the last pair, 6 moves to place the final\ncorner and permute the U corners, 9 moves to place the final middle\nedge and orient the U edges, and 14 to finish with ZBLL, that's still\na 52 move average.  However, I'm fairly certain you can get the F2L\nstep down closer to 20 using Xcross and opposite color solving, and\nthe other numbers are highballing it (just in case).  I think the\nfinal average will be closer to 46-48 moves.  On top of only using 1/7\nof the algs required for ZB (and only having 1/7 of the decision\nchoices to make on the fly, not to mention learning), it's got a great\npotential for spike times with skips and short cases.  A great\npossible case that includes all of the steps could be as short as 17\nmoves after the F2L step.  With a decent F2L, that's a non lucky\nsub-40 moves.  Good enough for an advanced rank on the FMC.  Of\ncourse, full ZB will inevitably average fewer moves, and have the\npotential for bigger spikes and fewer moves, but I think this is a\nnice compromise for number of algs and potential.\n\n> -Mike\n\nP.S.

Also I still have\n5-10 ZBF2L that I'm fuzzy on, but it feels good to know I haven't\nforgotten much after this long hiatus.\n\nAlso, in response to Mike's question about ZBF2L, I talked to Lars V\nabout that, and we think that if it uses too many extra moves it would\nprolong F2L too much, since ZBF2L is slower than F2L anyway, and it's\nreally worth it.  Also a lot of the all edges incorrect ZBF2L cases\nare actually really, really nice.\n\nSometimes on the third pair I'll do partial edge control to orient\nedges, and you can also do this to flip edges, and get an all edges\nincorrect case.\n\nSo yeah I think partial edge control is a good idea for the 3rd pair,\nbut otherwise that extends the F2L move count alot and you lose time,\neven with an RU finish for ZBF2L.\n\nJust my $0.02 though,\nChris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It's \nquite possible to orient edges during the 3rd or even 2nd pair, but \ntherein lie a couple of problems (at least problems I haven't worked \nout a strategy for yet!)\n\nFirstly, because when coming to the 3rd pair, you have 2 unsolved \npairs, it's quite difficult to spot exactly the orientation of the \nedges, and which edges if any need to be affected. Sometimes it's \ncan look like you have no good edges, and so you might insert a pair \nR' F R F', but the situation was such that it didn't really help \nmatters, because you may have flipped one edge while unflipping \nanother. \n\nAlso, if you try to flip edges during the 2nd pair, it gets \nincreasingly hard to make sure to not undo in the 3rd pair what you \nhave made good in the 2nd pair :)\n\nI would love to hear ideas on this.\n\nDan :)\n\n--- In zbmethod@yahoogroups.com, Mike Bennett <mikeisadumbname@...> \nwrote:\n>\n> There are 306 cases for the ZBF2L.\n> \n> What if we could try orienting the edges early?\n> \n> I know Dan Harris has been playing around with orienting the edges \nat the\n> very beginning of the solve, but what about during the other 3 \npairs?
